                                    <td>This unit covers the broad area of behavioural ecologyâ€”how an animal's behaviour is adapted to its physical and social environment. The unit comprises five broad sections: (1) foundations of behavioural ecology; (2) sexual selection; (3) perception and signaling; (4) kinship, conflict, cooperation and (5) predator-prey interactions.  The unit integrates these themes within an evolutionary framework that explores individual plasticity and the genetic basis of behaviour, along with a strong mechanistic basis of how perceptual systems work (e.g. vision which will set limits to behavioural capacity). Lectures are complemented by a practical component to develop skills in review and critique of the primary literature and the development of research skills. During a literature review exercise, students are guided through tutorials to locate and read original journal articles, make use of standard reference texts and online resources, and understand basic ideas and models in behavioural ecology. Students also undertake a research project to develop skills in experimental design, data collection and analysis. In both exercises (literature review and research project), students communicate their findings through formal scientific reports and short PowerPoint presentations.</td>

                    <p>ANIM3365 - ANIM3365_SEM-2-2019_2019 - SEM-2-2019 - 2019 - Face to face / Blended learning</p>
                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>The Behavioural Ecology unit covers the broad area of behavioural ecology â€“ how an animalâ€™s behaviour is adapted to its physical and social environment. The unit comprises five modules: (1) Foundations of Behavioural Ecology; (2) Sexual Selection; (3) Perception and Signalling; (4) Predator-Prey Interactions; and (5) Kinship, Conflict, Cooperation and Social Behaviour. The unit is taught by a team of lecturers who combine expertise in all of these areas. The unit integrates these themes within an evolutionary framework that explores the adaptive basis of behaviour, individual plasticity and the genetic basis of behaviour, ecological interactions governing social, sexual and antipredator behaviours, along with a strong mechanistic understanding of how perceptual systems work. Lectures are complemented by a practical component to develop skills in review and critique of the primary literature and the development of research skills. During a literature review exercise, students are guided through tutorials to locate and read original journal articles, make use of standard reference texts and online resources, and understand basic ideas and models in behavioural ecology. Students also undertake a research project to develop skills in experimental design, data collection and analysis. In both exercises (literature review and research project), students communicate their findings through formal scientific reports and short PowerPoint presentations.</p></pre>
                    <h3>Lecture Capture System</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>In accordance with UWAâ€™s policy on lecture capture all lectures* in enabled venues will be recorded and made available to stream and download by enrolled students via the Lecture Capture System (LCS) for the duration of the unit (including Supplementary and Deferred Examinations period).

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre>
                    <h3>Teaching and Learning Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>Our goal in this unit it to put YOU at the centre of your learning. We have designed a variety of engaging learning activities that will encourage you to learn collaboratively with your peers, tutors and lecturers. This means that you ultimately set the pace of your learning, both inside and outside the classroom. This approach supports your development as individuals but also empowers you to solve conceptual or practical problems outside the â€˜formalâ€™ learning environment by working collaboratively (i.e. not exclusively through a one-way stream of information delivered as part of a lecture). Our teaching styles recognise that you have individual learning needs and capabilities, and our approaches to teaching aim to break down perceived barriers among students and teaching staff. See Unit Structure (below) for further details of these learning activities.</p></pre>
                    <h3>Unit Structure</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>There are two 'Lecture Tutorials' each week. These slots will be filled either with formal lectures or interactive â€˜flippedâ€™ classes. Where we conduct flipped classes, a recording of the formal lecture will be made available to you one week prior to the scheduled class. When we run flipped classes, you must view recorded lectures and read the associated reading material before each class. The flipped classes will not work if you have not seen this material beforehand. Flipped classes provide an opportunity to think more deeply into the topics covered in the formal lecture, discuss key topics in an informal and friendly environment, receive and provide feedback from/to peers, and interact with teaching staff. The flipped classes also typically provide an opportunity to understand how we set exam questions and how to construct an appropriate answer. Note that flipped classes are NOT recorded as they rely on discussions that mainly take place among students. Whether we are running â€˜standardâ€™ or flipped classes, lecturers are always happy to answer questions, so please interrupt us if you do not understand something or require further information on a topic. Attendance is strongly encouraged for all lecture tutorials, as these will not be recorded. 

There is no set textbook for this unit. You will be guided to specific readings associated with each lecture and during discussion groups. A reading list for lectures and flipped classes will be added to the Unitâ€™s Blackboard site and updated as the semester progresses. The final theory exam will draw on material covered in lectures, flipped classes and the core reading material set for each lecture.

Lectures are complemented by a practical component to help you develop skills in review and critique of the primary literature, data collection, statistical analysis, data interpretation and communication. 

Specific details of the assessment tasks are provided in the Unit Guide (see Information tab in LMS). Please refer to this guide for key dates associated with each assessment task. Please also refer to the Practical Timetable in LMS for details of when attendance is required (e.g. briefing sessions) or encouraged (e.g. practical statistics workshop) or when online resources associated with practical work are available (e.g. pre-lab videos, online statistics tuition workshop).</p></pre>

The following requirements are taken from the â€˜Instructions to Authorsâ€™ guide in the journalâ€™s website (<a href='https://academic.oup.com/beheco/pages/information_for_authors' target='_blank'>https://academic.oup.com/beheco/pages/information_for_authors</a>):

â€˜All works included in the reference section should be referred to in the text. Citations should be typed alphabetically on a separate sheet, double-spaced and unnumbered. They should be referred to in the text by the name of the first author followed by 'et al.', followed by the year of publication in parentheses: (Able et al. 2000) or Able et al.(2000). If there are only two authors please list both, i.e. Able and Cabbott 2000. The order for references within parentheses in the text should be chronological and then alphabetical. For works by the exact same author(s) in the same year, append a lowercase a, b, c, etc. to the year of publication. If the works differ slightly in names, provide enough surnames to distinguish the one group from the other. The reference list should conform to the following styles:

Journal article
Author AB, Author CD, Author EF. 2001a. Title of article. J Hered. 60:128-132.

Paper in a conference proceedings
Author AB, editor. 2001b. Article title. Name of conference; YYYY MMM DD-DD; location. City, State or Country of publication: Publisher's name. p. 137-180.

Book
Author GH, Author IJ. 1999a. Title of book. City, State or Country of publication: Publisher's name.

Chapter in a book
Author GH, Author IJ. 1999b. Title of a chapter: a subtitle. In: Able MN, Baker OP, editors. Title of book. 2nd ed. City, State or Country of publication: Publisher's name. p. 200-235.

Only published material or material accepted for publication should be listed in the references; personal communications, unpublished data, manuscripts in preparation, etc., should be incorporated in the text in parentheses with the initials surname of the source, e.g., (OP Able, personal communication).â€™

The unit is organised into five modules. After each module, we will provide a short revision quiz for self-assessment purposes. These quizzes do not form part of the formal assessment of the unit but are designed to embed core concepts from the lectures and flipped classes and make revision fun and ultimately more rewarding than simply memorising a series of â€˜factsâ€™. Indeed, we do not test factual recall in this unit, but rather we encourage you to think through and solve problems. Problem solving exercises form a major component of the final exam (see below) and to do well in these exercises you will need to think about concepts covered in lectures. Quizzes will help with this; they are â€˜interactiveâ€™, in the sense that you will receive feedback on your answers (whether correct or incorrect), and may point you towards resources that will further your understanding of these concepts. So please take the opportunity of participating in these online quizzes and contact your lecturers if you require any support.

Computing and software:
You will need a computer with basic statistical software (Excel, possibly R if you are confident with the program, or any statistical package that can handle basic statistics). If you attend the practical statistics workshop, you will need to bring a laptop loaded with your statistical software of choice.</p></pre>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
