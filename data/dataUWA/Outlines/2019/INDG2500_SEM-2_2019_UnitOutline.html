The unit begins with an introduction to the 60,000 year history of Aboriginal people in the North and the significance of Country. We will then examine the actions of colonisation and effects these have had on Country, Aboriginal people’s connection to Country in the North and the impact on Aboriginal peoples and communities. Together with this, the unit will explore and interrogate the global importance of these areas in terms of industry and mining and how these often compete with obligations to land from local Aboriginal groups</p></pre></p>

Weekly seminars will be presented by presenters knowledgeable in the specific topic, to stimulate critical thinking and to raise questions to increase learning about the concepts offered in each seminar. In preparation for each seminar please analyse materials and note any queries and bring these to the seminar. Opportunities to ask questions will be offered and a dialogue will support the directions the seminar will cover. Completing the Essential Readings/Viewings will enable you to gain deeper understandings of the seminar content. 

Workshop
Please prepare for your workshops by engaging with the weekly workshop guide and the Essential Readings/Viewings. Workshop tasks will enable students to critically reflect on the
weekly seminar and to contribute openly thoughts and questions regarding the points being raised. The workshops will focus on sharing critical reflections on the week's themes and discussing the questions set for that topic. Class activities will be integrated into the discussion to stimulate further engagement and facilitate deeper understanding.


WORKSHOP GUIDES
Workshop guides have been designed to provide some background information on the week’s content and set questions to help guide your reading/viewing. It would be beneficial to consult the workshop guide before you complete your reading/viewing as this will help focus your reading/viewing and you will also be able to engage at a deeper level during workshops discussions and activities.

LEARNING ON COUNTRY – FIELD TRIP
Learning on Country is a significant component of learning for Indigenous students/peoples and also for non-Indigenous students/peoples’ learning. Country encompasses more than just the physical environment, it is knowledge, the ancestors, kin/people and spiritual. Learning on Country is a way of learning through connecting with Country and the knowledge within Country.

Please note, students will need to participate in all Seminars, and attend/participate in all Workshops and Excursions. Clashes with timetabling and or other unit requirements will need to be solved prior to this unit’s commencement.

Read the guidelines carefully: <a href='https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/Oxford' target='_blank' >https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/Oxford</a> You are required to include footnoted citations and include a reference list. Supportive figures, illustrations used in the essay should be referenced in their titles using footnoted citations. Essays and assignments will be assessed according to the adherence of these referencing standards. Presentation Formats It is recommended that essays be typed. Essay text should be 12 point, in a clear font, e.g. Arial, Helvetica, Times, New York, Palatino or similar, with lines one and one-half spaced. Paragraphs should be denoted by a single extra return (you may indent paragraphs if you wish). Please do not use extraneous formatting, such as headers, footers or tabs if they are not necessary. Please include page numbers. The required length of the essay does not include footnotes. Students must provide a word count at the top of their assessment item at the time of submission. Refer further Essay requirements in the Assessment Brief. Important Note: You will be allowed 3 submission attempts so that you can check your Turnitin 'originality report' to ensure you have paraphrased/quoted adequately and acknowledged the sources. Further information on how to do this and on text matching can be found via this link: <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/textmatching/forstudents' target='_blank' >http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/textmatching/forstudents</a>. Plagiarism Academic misconduct includes plagiarism, collusion and other forms of cheating. The University of Western Australia defines Academic Misconduct as "any activity or practice engaged in by a student that breaches explicit guidelines relating to the production of work for assessment, in a manner that compromises or defeats the purpose of that assessment". Plagiarism occurs when someone disguises or misrepresents the authorship of work and claims it as his or her own. It can occur in various forms: (i) presenting, part or whole of another student's essay, design project or artwork as one's own; (ii) copying phrases, sentences or passages from a published source (usually an article or a book) without acknowledging this by quotation marks and a reference; (iii) substantially copying design elements or images from other design projects or artworks, such as to misrepresent the substance, strategy or personal expression of the original design project or artwork; (iii) presenting in your own words an idea, argument or interruption from another source, without indicating the reference Remember always insert references when using other people's ideas. What are the penalties? Plagiarism strikes at the heart of ethical scholarship, and the School has grown increasingly concerned about plagiarism in student essays. In addition to being a form of fraud, plagiarism negates the value of essays, designs or artworks as a means of developing independent thought, analysis, design strategy or creative expression. Unintentional plagiarism will also be penalised. The University views plagiarism very seriously and substantial or repeated plagiarism may result in a student's failing the course or, in extreme cases, being expelled from the University. The defense "but I have done this for other departments or teachers" is unacceptable - it is rather like the driver who, when caught speeding, complains that (s)he hasn't been caught before. How to Avoid Plagiarism The best way to avoid plagiarism in essay writing is to get into the habit of distinguishing your own work from that by other people. We assume that unreferenced work is your own, so make sure that phrases and sentences that are not your own are in quotation marks and given precise references, and that ideas and arguments that are not your own are properly referenced. In cases of concepts or facts that are widely used or known this may not be necessary - for example "liberals believe in the importance of individual freedom" or "Australia has six states". To avoid accidental plagiarism, ensure that the notes you use to prepare your essay clearly identify quotations and have full references. </p></pre></p>

WEEKLY TOPICS AND READINGS/VIEWINGS 
[this information is also clearly listed in the weekly Topics folders]

WEEK ONE – Seminar and Workshop
[Use your workshop guide in the weekly topic folders to guide your reading/viewing and prepare for the workshop]

Seminar: Unit Overview and ‘Country, Mother, Knowledges: Truths Behind Colonisation of the North’ 

Today’s seminar topic will introduce you to the significance of Land as Country, Land as Mother and to the understandings that Knowledges are created by Land/Country/Mother. These are Truths that are over 60, 000 years old, long before the 200 year history of colonisation of the North and of Australia. The seminar will also begin your journey in understanding the silenced truths behind the histories of colonisation of the North and the significance these truths have for Country.  

No Workshop. 
 Instead, prepare for the week 2 workshop and view Part A and Part B of “Exile and the Kingdom”. Viewing Guide, take specific notes on –

•	What are some of the histories told in part one and part two?
•	How do these histories compare to the known Australian history of colonisation and settlement?
•	What were your responses and feelings whilst viewing “Exile and the Kingdom”?

Bring your notes to the workshop in week 2.

WEEK TWO – Seminar and Workshop
[Use your workshop guide in the weekly topic folders to guide your reading/viewing and prepare for the workshop]

Seminar: Belonging to Country: Heartsick for Country, The Killing Fields of Murujuga, ‘The Flying Foam Massacre (Massacres 19th Century)

Workshop Focus: Introductions and Interrogating How We Know History
Ensure you bring your notes from week on the film Exile and The Kingdom, seminar notes from week 1 and week 2 and the notes from your readings for this week.

We commenced the unit with an introduction to the 60,000 year history of Aboriginal people in the North and the significance of Country. We will now begin to examine the competing histories by viewing and listening to the histories and voices of Aboriginal people. You would have watched the film Exile and the Kingdom in your recommended workshop hours last week. On the other side of this is the story of colonisation, throughout this unit we question what we know and interrogate the process of knowing.

In today’s workshop we will interrogate how we know history through the discussion of  your notes on the film ‘Exile and the Kingdom’ and this week’s seminar Flying Foam Massacre – The Killing Fields of Murujuga’, and we will begin to examine representations of the colonisation of the north. Bastian’s article ‘Reading Colonial Records Through an Archival Lens: The Provenance of Place, Space and Creation’ will be significant in opening the lenses you use to read and engage in archival/historical records and information.

Workshop Focus Questions/Tasks: 

•	How are these narratives of history represented? 
•	What is meant by “History is meant to be about the truth but some truths are silenced or hidden”?
•	How do we interrogate history to find the truths?

WEEK THREE – Seminar and Workshop
[Use your workshop guide in the weekly topic folders to guide your reading/viewing and prepare for the workshop]

Seminar: Jandamarra (white fella name ‘Pigeon’)

Workshop Focus: Resistance: Fighting for Country and People  

The focus of this week’s workshop is on Jandamarra and the Bunuba resistance. June Oscar AO writes in the forward of Howard Pederson’s and Banjo Worrunmurra’s book ‘Jandamarra and the Bunuba Resistance’:
“As a young girl growing up in Bunuba country I heard Jandamara’s story form my old people many times. While the story was known by all Bunuba people, Grandfather Wirranmarra (Banjo Worrunmurra) knew the full version. It was his responsibility to keep telling the story so that we, the Bunuba people, would never lose our history, our sense of wonder at the magic and power of our country and the knowledge of the deep injustices inflicted on our people from those who invaded our country.” 

Workshop focus questions/task:

•	Consider June Oscar’s words and analyse why telling this story is important to the Bunuba people’s history and Country.
•	Jandamarra, outlaw or freedom fighter. Discuss how history narratives can position people as outlaw or hero?
•	What role do you feel policing played in Jandamarra’s story?

WEEK FOUR – Seminar and Workshop
[Use your workshop guide in the weekly topic folders to guide your reading/viewing and prepare for the workshop]

Seminar: ‘Stations, Finger Money: Stolen Wages’
Workshop Focus: Station Life – Indentured Labour and Slavery

This week we focus particularly on Aboriginal people in the North who worked on pastoral stations because they stayed on their Country. However, Aboriginal people working on stations were often treated like slave labour. Different forms of legislation ensured that the pastoralists could maintain control of their Aboriginal labour force and this was enforced by the police. The labour experiences of Aboriginal people of course changed over time and the readings provide perspectives of these different times.

Workshop focus questions/task:

•	Examine the concept of slavery, what is it? What is indentured labour? How do these two concepts apply to Aboriginal pastoral workers?
•	Compare the experiences of Aboriginal men to that of Aboriginal women.
•	What forms of resistance were available to Aboriginal people on pastoral stations?

WEEK SIX – Seminar and Workshop
[Use your workshop guide in the weekly topic folders to guide your reading/viewing and prepare for the workshop]

Seminar: “The Untold History of Policing in the Kimberley District”

Workshop Focus: Criminalising Resistance

How did Aboriginal people resist colonial incursions on their lands? We’ve already looked at the example of Jandamarra who is considered a freedom fighter but how else did Aboriginal people resist colonization? The livestock was sacred in the eyes of the pastoralists for it was the means to their attaining their wealth. Pastoralists viewed the livestock as their property and they considered the spearing of livestock a criminal offence. However, when Aboriginal people speared livestock it was not only for meat to eat, it was also because the livestock was destroying the waterholes and their country they had owned in their families eternally. Not all forms of resistance were obvious like Jandamarra’s fight, Choo’s and Owen’s readings provide some insights to other forms of resistance that were seen as crimes. You will also find the newspaper articles both sets of readings will be helpful in identifying some of the different forms of resistance by Aboriginal people of the North, particularly against pastoralist and station owners.

Workshop focus questions/task:

•	What were some of the other forms of resistance Aboriginal peoples of the North carried out?

WEEK SEVEN – Seminar and Workshop
[Use your workshop guide in the weekly topic folders to guide your reading/viewing and prepare for the workshop]

Seminar: The Kimberley and Global Connectivity

Workshop Focus: Pearling, Slaving, Blackbirding in the North

This week we particularly focus on pearling and the North. Country, which includes land, seas and waterways in the North was and still is rich in resources. Industries in the North such as the pearling industry have been built on exploitation and inhuman treatment.  “The pearling industry had a notorious reputation for blackbirding, high mortality rates and sexual abuse of women and girls”.  Often, Aboriginal men, women and children were captured and forcibly taken far away (usually in neck and ankle chains) to dive for pearls or stations. Many died from the inhuman treatment, abuse, less than human working conditions and killings for non-compliance. 

Groups will be assigned a reading each – The Essential Readings have been published during three different eras and have been written from three different positions/worldviews. You will consider this when addressing the workshop focus questions.

Workshop Focus Questions/Tasks: 

•	Compare the descriptions of Aboriginal people and incidents in each article 
o	How and why were Aboriginal women and young girls enslaved?
o	How was this justified by colonial powers and people?
o	How does the era of publication and the position of the author (world view, gender etc) influence the representations of Aboriginal people and in particular Aboriginal women and girls in the articles?

WEEK EIGHT – Seminar and Workshop

Seminar: Frontier Wars: 20th Century Massacres

Workshop Focus: History told through personal stories and Aboriginal artists who painted their history.

For many of us there has been a lacking in knowing about our collective past since the onset of colonisation in Australia . Personal knowledge of this past from Aboriginal people of the North has only recently confronted Australians in the latter part of the 20th century. We have mainly learned of this past from personal accounts collected by linguists and anthropologists working in the north. However, recent years have seen the development of Aboriginal led research, writing and publications by Aboriginal people and Communities documenting and telling their own stories. Importantly, there has been the development of a long awaited recognition of the passing on of culture, history and knowledge through visual images as well as the growth in Aboriginal artists who are painting their cultural histories. Additionally, significant development in research has seen the uncovering of evidence of massacres committed in the 20th Century. This workshop will focus on case studies of the recommended readings/viewing listed below. Groups will be allocated a case study to view/read in preparation for the workshop.

Workshop focus questions/task:

Case study 1: Video clips, Whispering Hearts
Case study 2: A Massacre at Christmas Creek

WEEK NINE – Seminar and Workshop
[Use your workshop guide in the weekly topic folders to guide your reading/viewing and prepare for the workshop]

Seminar: The 1946 Aboriginal Pastoral Workers Strike
Workshop Focus: 20th Century resistance: The Significance of Resistance and Global Connections

The story of the 1946 Aboriginal Pastoral Workers' Strike is one that has never officially ended. An event more important than the Eureka Stockade but never recorded in written histories - the passive resistance by 800 Aboriginal station workers against the appalling living and working conditions thrust upon them. 
‘Australian industrial relations have scarcely touched upon the dispute because it does not fit within the normal institutional framework of the Australian industrial system. It does not, for example, fit in with the conventional demands of workers, for it was always a dispute that involved more than just wages and conditions. Indeed, strikers refused to return to work even when the wages and conditions initially demanded had been implemented.’   

Workshop focus questions/task:

•	What was the outcome of this strike? 
•	Why do you think it is that Aboriginal pastoral workers would not get equal wages for another 20 years until the Gurindji walk off at Wave Hill in 1966?
•	What was happening globally in terms of working conditions and wages?
•	What did Armstrong’s statement mean  “it was always a dispute that involved more than just wages and conditions.”?

WEEK ELEVEN – Seminar and Workshop
[Use your workshop guide in the weekly topic folders to guide your reading/viewing and prepare for the workshop]

Seminar: PART 1- ‘Injury and desecration: the Disturbance of Significant sites in the northwest and Kimberley’

Workshop Focus: Whose Law, Whose Land?: Mining and Native Title

In the 60,000 year plus history of Australia, the law came from the land and the Aboriginal people’s across the continent belonged to the land. The myth of terra nullius was declared only 200 years ago, with the British assertion of sovereignty in 1788. It was not until 3 June 1992 that the Mabo determination overturned the terra nullius fiction. Mabo 1992 provided the impetus for legislating Land Rights and Native Title. This week through the case study of the Nookanbah Native Title struggle we will examine whose law and whose land has been significant and in dispute through the continuing struggle between mining and Native Title. We will also begin to interrogate, what actually is at the centre of this struggle.

Seminar: PART 2 - ‘Protecting Australia's oldest heritages: Eastern Guruma’s Ngajanha Marnta (Spear. Hill)

Workshop Focus: Country and Natural Resources: Contested Ground

Aboriginal people and their ancestors have lived in the lands in the North for millennia, as have Aboriginal people in other regions of Australia. Land and water were and still are sacred and integral to cultural belief systems as well as for survival and sustenance. However, since the 18th Century as Duff 2017 asserts, “For more than two centuries of Australian law and policy regulating freshwater resources, the rights and interests of Aboriginal people were largely ignored until quite recently. Although statutory land rights have existed since the 1970s, and native title has been recognised since 1992 with the courts gradually clarifying a range of questions about its application to land and marine areas, the laws that regulate freshwater consistently failed to address Aboriginal peoples’ needs, priorities, and traditional-legal entitlements.”  This week we will use two articles (Yu 1999 and Rumley & Barber 2004) as case studies to examine the cultural significance of water to Aboriginal people in the Kimberley, the Pilbara people and it’s importance to survival and sustenance.  We will refer to a current AITSIS 2017 research report on Native Title and Freshwater Outcomes to assist in exploring the relationship between water (a cultural and natural resource), Native Title and Common Law. Groups will be allocated a case study and will read that particular article and the reference article in preparation for the workshop.

WEEK THIRTEEN – Seminar and Workshop
[Use your workshop guide in the weekly topic folders to guide your reading/viewing and prepare for the workshop] 

Seminar: “Post-Colonial—NOT!” [Anita Heiss, 2009] 

Workshop Focus: Sovereignty and Colonisation of the North: Nation Rebuilding

“The term ‘post‐colonial’ is used generally to describe all cultures affected by the imperial process from the moment of colonisation to the present day. It is also considered as the most appropriate term for the new cross‐cultural criticism which has emerged in recent years and for the discourse through which it is constituted.”   Five years after Mabo 1992, Irene Watson argued “… [t]erra nullius has not stopped; the violations of our law have continued, the ecological destruction of the earth our mother continues with a vengeance, we are still struggling to return to the land, and the assimilator-integrator model is still being forced upon us.”  Nearly, twenty years later, Irene Watson writes, ‘the future is our past, we once were sovereign and we still are’ . 

Workshop focus questions/task:

In this final week we have some “Big Questions” that need to be raised in order to look forward and beyond this unit. It is important that I ask you to revisit the key points and ideas of the unit in preparation for the seminar and this workshop. This week’s seminar will provide some key points on post-colonialism, sovereignty and Native Title. In the workshop we will draw from our understanding of the key points and concepts in the unit, the seminar and the Essential Reading for this week in order to analyse how Watson’s 2012 article may apply to the North, the issues raised in the documentary Undermined: Tales of the Kimberley and to raise the ‘Big Questions’ that can enable us to look beyond this unit. Please ensure you bring your notes to the workshop.

Key words/ideas in the seminar and reading to familiarise yourself with:

Post-colonial
Native Title
Treaty
Sovereignty
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples

A GUIDE TO APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE AND TERMINOLOGY:

It is important to be sensitive to the use of appropriate language and terminology when referring to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This guide is to inform you on preferred terminology for the School of Indigenous Studies, so you can become more confident in your choices about what terms to use. However, it is not definitive and cannot cover all contexts, so as a general rule, if in doubt, ASK first!

Collective and Inclusive Terms
‘Indigenous people(s)’ and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people(s)’ are terms commonly used to collectively refer to Australia’s first peoples.  
‘Indigenous peoples’ is a term most frequently used in an international context, particularly in relation to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) and The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples www.social.un.org/index/IndigenousPeoples.aspx
For more information see:  Indigenous Peoples Indigenous Voices Fact Sheet: Who Are Indigenous Peoples?  www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf

Some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people object to using the term ‘Indigenous’ because it fails to respect their own identity and preferences and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ is the preferred term.  However, both terms ‘Indigenous people(s)’ and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people(s)’ are acceptable to use in the course. Use capital letters for ‘Indigenous’ and ‘Aboriginal’ when you are referring specifically to Aboriginal peoples in Australia.
In many areas, the term ‘Aboriginal people’ is increasingly used in preference to ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’.  In Western Australia there has been a clear and stated community preference for use of the term ‘Aboriginal people’ as the inclusive term rather than ‘Indigenous’ or ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’. 

This is demonstrated by the following examples from two key government agencies:  
•	In 2013, Western Australia’s Department of Indigenous Affairs replaced the term ‘Indigenous’ in its title with ‘Aboriginal’, its stated reason being that: "The Department of Aboriginal Affairs (formerly Indigenous Affairs) has been renamed to more accurately reflect the identity of Aboriginal people in Western Australia. This change is in line with requests from the State's Aboriginal community." <a href='http://www.daa.wa.gov.au/' target='_blank' >http://www.daa.wa.gov.au/</a>
•	The Department of Health (WA) stated rationale on using the term ‘Aboriginal’ is that: "Within Western Australia, the term Aboriginal is used in preference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, in recognition that Aboriginal people are the original inhabitants of Western Australia. No disrespect is intended to our Torres Strait Islander colleagues and community”. <a href='http://www.aboriginal.health.wa.gov.au/home/' target='_blank' >http://www.aboriginal.health.wa.gov.au/home/</a>
‘Aboriginal people(s)’ is also appropriate to use in the course. 

Diverse Communities
‘Aboriginal’ and ‘Indigenous’ are both terms imposed after colonisation, which don’t reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of the more than 250 Aboriginal language groups across Australia as well as the diversity within each of these groups. 
Aboriginal peoples prefer to identify themselves in their own language terms e.g. Noongar, Palyku, Yamatji.  Students should be sensitive to this use, but care should be taken to have an appropriate Aboriginal reference point when using these terms. It can be confusing as spellings may have changed over time or may merely reflect regional or individual preferences. For example, UWA uses ‘Noongar’ as per the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council <a href='http://www.noongar.org.au' target='_blank' >http://www.noongar.org.au</a>

Language and Terminology to Avoid
The term ‘Aborigine(s)’ is often regarded as having negative connotations and is now regarded as less appropriate, out-dated or even offensive, so use ‘Aboriginal people’ instead.
Generally avoid abbreviations, as they are like to be offensive.
•	There is no acceptable abbreviation for ‘Aboriginal’. 
•	Do not use ATSI as an abbreviation of ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’ in written or oral communication.  Exceptions to this are in the context of a recognised acronym for an organisation e.g. ‘AIATSIS’ is the acronym for the ‘Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies’.
Avoid using anthropological terms such as clans, tribes. Aboriginal people do not generally use these terms in Western Australia you can refer instead to ‘Aboriginal communities’ or ‘Aboriginal language groups’. 
‘Aboriginal’ and ‘non-Aboriginal’ people should be used in preference to ‘black’ and ‘white’ people etc.  
While Aboriginal people may use terms/language to refer to themselves, such as ‘blackfellas’, this does not imply permission for other people to use such terms.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
