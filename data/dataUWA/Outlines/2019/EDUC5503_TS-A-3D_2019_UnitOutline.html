Students learn how to apply theories to support meaningful, communicative and educative interaction in a range of early childhood settings. These include individual and collaborative play; peer teaching and learning; teacher–learner interaction; intentional teaching, sustained shared conversations and questioning strategies; self regulation, behaviour management and the building of positive self-esteem. Students explore various early childhood pedagogies such as social, relational and play based pedagogies. The unit has a strong emphasis on developing students' skills and strategies for supporting children's oral language development along with other communicative and social competencies. Students engage with the Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF) to guide practice and support planning and implementation of quality teaching and learning which recognises the role of partnerships with parents and caregivers.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>This unit builds upon competencies developed in Semester 1 of the Master of Teaching Early Childhood Specialisation, especially in the units Language and Literacy in Early Childhood Education (EDUC5504) and the Artistic and Expressive Child (EDUC5520), and on knowledge from Development, Teaching and Learning (EDUC5485) and Teaching Mathematics in the Early Years (EDUC5502). Close links have also been designed with the Semester 2 unit, Managing Infant and Early Childhood Learning Environments (EDUC5506). Pre-service teachers are encouraged to explore these synergies. This unit, Social Interaction and the Developing Child (EDUC5503), has four key and related foci: a) theories of play; b) oral language development and planning and programming for it; c) partnerships in social interaction; d) social and emotional development.

Social interaction takes many shapes in everyday life. The most obvious for us as adults is verbal, but we all make meaning and react to gesture, to visual and musical symbols, and to facial and vocal expression. Interaction through these modes, or media, may take place in many contexts; communication may, for example, be co-operative, competitive, dyadic, large group or hierarchical. Teachers need to understand the importance and complexity of the social interactions that take place in early childhood settings, the classroom, the playground, at home and in other social arenas. In order to form relationships with peers, siblings, teachers, parents, and members of the wider community, children need to engage in many kinds of social interaction. There are various purposes of social interaction, including enquiry, exploration and investigation, self-expression, sharing and connecting. Each purpose necessitates a different form or structure.
Whilst play’s various forms are not all concerned with social interaction, many of them are. Even solitary play is often concerned with the exploration of social concepts and skills. Educators’ and carers’ skilful interaction with young children through and around play adds further weight to its significance as the foundational site of early learning.

Understanding social interaction is essential for all teachers. This is reflected in models of cognitive, physical, personal, social, emotional, and moral development, and in social learning theory and constructivism. These principles were central to the Semester 1 unit, Development, Teaching and Learning (EDUC5485). In particular, early childhood educators need to develop expertise in the analysis of talk and in the assessment and teaching of oral language. Apart from developing an understanding of human agency and social structures, teachers need to develop an extensive repertoire of communicative skills and transactional strategies that facilitate the effective education of young children across developmental domains and support the growth of ‘general capabilities’*.

Multi-mode with face to face classes and an online component. Some parts of the unit will be delivered via a 'flipped classroom' model. Some parts of the assessment involve activities at an Early Childhood Education and Care setting, to be carried out during Semester 2. The Unit Coordinator will organise sessions for when this will occur.

The following teaching and learning strategies may be used in this unit: lecture, presentation, small and large group discussion as well as strategies such as jigsaw, graffiti wall, and quick writes to help students develop a deeper understanding of the concepts and theories presented in the weekly lecture and required readings.

(b) they contact the unit coordinator by email within 5 University working days of the release of the result and formally request a resubmission. 
(c) A resubmitted assignment that is deemed to be a ‘fail’ by the unit coordinator, will receive the original failing mark for the component. 
(d) Where resubmission is approved, the reassessed mark is capped at the assessment pass mark, unless an application for mitigation is approved in accordance with the University Policy on Assessment: Special Consideration (UP11/23). 
(e) A resubmission is normally due one week after being approved by the unit coordinator. 
(f) Assignments that are failed on the grounds of lateness or academic misconduct will not normally be considered for resubmission.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>

UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
