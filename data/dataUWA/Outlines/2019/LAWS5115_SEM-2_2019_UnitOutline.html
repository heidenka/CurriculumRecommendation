Contrary to the 'Academic Information' above, the focus of this unit will be on litigation in superior courts in Western Australia.

Please read this unit outline together with the following important documents on LMS, among others: (1) Procedure Draft Schedule, (2) Procedure Reading Guide.</p></pre>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre>

Activities to be done include, but are not limited to, reading, research, and drafting. They will be done at home and in class. The assessment design is intended to encourage students to engage in those activities. Teaching activities have been designed to prepare students for working in litigation in Western Australia.

The Procedure Reading Guide, and slides for the lectures, will be uploaded on LMS.

Note that lectures are not recorded. 'Lectures' will include practical activities, consideration of court documents, and presentations by senior members of the profession.</p></pre>

Such participation is necessary for students to achieve the unit learning outcomes. That participation feeds into the assessment of the tutorial program.

Additionally, all students are expected to prepare for tutorials and to contribute to tutorial discussions. Mere physical attendance at tutorials is not 'participation' and will not, without more, result in the award of marks for the tutorial program.

Marks for participation, as part of the tutorial program, will be based on the extent to which a student: 
•	demonstrates that he or she is well prepared for classes (including the preparation of assigned work); 
•	is able to identify the issues raised in tutorial activities;
•	understands the issues and principles raised in tutorial activities; and
•	participates constructively in class discussions by: answering questions if asked; volunteering a comment, question or answer in a way that is timely, respectful of others and develops the discussion.

It is the quality rather than the quantity of each student’s class participation that is most important. However, both quality and quantity is expected.

Guidelines for Evaluating Participation

(Adapted from guidelines adopted by Prof. Tyler which were in turn obtained from Prof. Richard J. Murnane at the Harvard Graduate School of Education)

Outstanding Contributor: Contributions to class discussion reflect exceptional preparation and are both substantive and insightful. Arguments are critical, well-constructed, articulate and persuasive. (8-10)

Good Contributor: Contributions to class discussion reflect thorough preparation and are relevant and well-considered. Arguments are informed and thoughtful providing good insights. (7-8)

Adequate Contributor: Contributions to class discussion reflect adequate preparation and are generally correct but not original and insightful. Arguments are largely derivative although clearly articulated. (5-6)

Unsatisfactory Contributor: Contributions to class discussion reflect inadequate preparation and are often incorrect or misguided. Arguments are seldom offered. When they are, they are derivative and lack insight and are not well presented. (2-4)

Non-Participant: Contributions to class discussion reflect little or no preparation and are minimal with no arguments or insights being provided. (0-1)</p></pre>

Referencing comes under the umbrella of 'form' and will be assessed. The assignment will require precise use of AGLC4. Further details will be provided on LMS in respect of that assessment and other components of assessment.</p></pre>
                    <h3>Texts</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>Completing readings is required but purchase of textbooks is not required. Readings will include open access content which will be hyperlinked in the Procedure Reading Guide. The Procedure Reading Guide will be available on LMS.

The following two books are highly recommended and will be made available in the Law Library in the High Demand area. Each topic will have required reading from one or both of these books, in addition to other reading. (1) Adrian Zuckerman et al, Zuckerman on Australian Civil Procedure (LexisNexis Butterworths, 2018). (2) Bernard Cairns, Australian Civil Procedure (Lawbook Co, 11th ed, 2016).</p></pre>

WORD COUNT OR PAGE COUNT: 

Limitations on length of documents are important to civil litigation practice. Accordingly, word counts and (page counts + form restrictions) are particularly important in this unit. Content beyond the relevant length limitation will be ignored, and additionally, further penalties (ie, non-award of marks) will be imposed in relation to content beyond the relevant length limitation. Precise details will be placed on LMS. The moral of the story: follow the instructions carefully. To the extent that this passage is contrary to another part of this unit outline, or to any other document, this passage prevails.</p></pre>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>

                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
