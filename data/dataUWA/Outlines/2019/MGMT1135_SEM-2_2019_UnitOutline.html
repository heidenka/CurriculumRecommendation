Organisational Behaviour is a social science discipline concerned with understanding the behaviour of individuals and groups in organisations. This unit will introduce you to the concepts, theories and applications of the study of organisational behaviour.

Organisations are composed of people. The study of human behaviour is, therefore, fundamental to understanding organisations and organisational effectiveness. This also means that organisational behaviour is relevant to all forms of business including businesses engaged in engineering, education, the arts, and physical and health sciences. Not only is organisational behaviour fascinating, it can also help us to understand life outside the classroom and in the workplace. This unit is concerned with learning how the study of human behaviour helps improve organisational, managerial and personal effectiveness. The unit will start you on a journey to understanding, integrating, and applying knowledge on why people act the way they do in organisations.

The teaching staff for this unit are passionate about Organisational Behaviour. We hope to spark your interest too, as we warmly welcome you to join us on this fascinating journey.

Unit Content
Do you believe workers will generally avoid doing anything unless they have to, and that they must be monitored, enticed, or even threatened to keep them working up to standard? Or, do you believe workers are generally eager to work hard, are concerned about what they produce and the contribution they make, and that they must be encouraged, trusted, and empowered to keep them working up to standard? Ask some of your friends what they think and you will get a variety of answers; we all have our own opinions about how people work, and how organisations work.

Because OB is about people, and we are all people, it is easy to think that our own opinions and experiences provide the best guide to understanding behaviour. While we would not imagine that our personal experiences and intuitions could give us an adequate understanding of the complexities of chemistry, genetics or palaeontology, when it comes to human behaviour everyone is an expert! But, often different people have had different experiences and have developed different opinions. What if your experiences are different to the experiences of some other people, or do not correspond to the situation at hand? This is when we need to look for research to help guide our actions and behaviour towards others at work. Evidence-based management is the idea that we lead and manage ourselves and others based on research and evidence not upon what we think is common sense. Like many CEOs and executives are now doing, MGMT1135 is based upon the premise of evidence-based management. As such, we will explore ideas around what makes for good research, as well as constantly touching base with what the research tells us, rather than just relying on our gut feel. Of course experience is useful, so the lectures and the tutorials encourage you to think about your own experiences but we will always tie it in to the theory and the research. We do this so that when you are your own business manager, or a manager of others, or just trying to understand those around you as you travel the world, you can rely on evidence to design practices and procedures, to predict and analyse management and people problems, and to understand and affect the actions and reactions of the people who make those organisations work.

Organisational behaviour includes some of the most personal and important issues that will affect your career.

-What motivates you, what motivates others?
-How do you react to the way you are treated?
-How will you treat other people when you have power over them?
-How do groups of people behave, and why?
-What can a manager do to affect the way people behave and what they do?

Unit Goal
Organisational behaviour is a foundation unit for those taking a major in Management or Human Resource Management in the Bachelor of Commerce. The goal is to provide students with an introduction to the study of organisational behaviour, its history, methods, and current state of knowledge, as well as to introduce students to how this knowledge is applied to improve the management of organisations and the well-being of those who work in them.</p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content.

                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>The learning outcomes of this unit are reflected in the teaching and learning strategies used. The lectures define areas, outline key theories and research in organisational behaviour, contrast alternative perspectives and identify points of debate. You are expected to participate in assigned activities, and to keep up-to-date with assigned reading so that you can benefit fully from the classes.

Tutorials build on the lecture material and draw upon your knowledge and experiences. Experiential activities and participative discussions are used to develop your critical thinking skills, creativity, and confidence in speaking on organisational behaviour topics. The practise opportunities provided in tutorials will help you cope with the oral test later in the semester.

You are expected to listen to the lectures, either in person or online, and to attend your allocated tutorial session. Attendance and participation in tutorials is expected and tutors will record attendance at each tutorial session. This is to ensure that all students are participating fully in the course and no one is missing out on the learning opportunities that are provided.

Everyone involved in the unit is expected to show a commitment to professionalism, social responsibility and ethical practice. Participants are also expected to be sensitive and committed to a better understanding of cultural, diversity-related, and international issues.

Teaching and Learning Evaluation
You may be asked to complete two evaluations during this unit: the Student Perception of Teaching (SPOT) and the Students Unit Reflective Feedback (SURF). The SPOT is optional and is an evaluation of the lecturer and the unit. The SURF is completed online and is a university wide survey and deals only with the unit. You will receive an email from the SURF office inviting you to complete the SURF when it is activated. We encourage you to complete the forms as your feedback is extremely important and can be used to make changes to the unit or lecturing style when appropriate. This feedback is very valuable, is accepted without prejudice and has been instrumental in improving teaching and learning in this unit.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Unit Structure</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>Lectures:
Two 1-hour lectures per week. Lecture 1 for the week is on Mondays, Lecture 2 is on Wednesdays.

Each of these two lectures will be repeated later on the same day as it is originally delivered, and students are timetabled to attend either the original or repeat streams of lectures depending on the number of enrollments in the unit. Check your own timetable on Student Connect for your assigned lecture times and locations if you are attending the Crawley campus.

Lectures will be recorded and made available to students in the unit through the Learning Management System. Recordings are solely for the purpose of study by students in the unit, they are subject to copyright and may not be provided to others.

Tutorial:
One 1-hour tutorial per week, commencing in the second week of semester.

You should attend your allocated tutorial session consistently. There will be experiential exercises to illustrate phenomena of organisational behaviour, and tutorials will also include many opportunities to ask questions and get help to understand topics.Weekly attendance will be recorded by the tutor, and there are participation marks associated with your contribution to the tutorial class activities and discussions.

The size of the tutorial classes is limited to 20 per tutor, and to maintain that limit a student may not normally attend any session other than the one to which the student is allocated.

Please refer to the Class Allocation System (CAS - <a href='https://www.cas.uwa.edu.au/' target='_blank' >https://www.cas.uwa.edu.au/</a>) page for the lecture and tutorial timetable.</p></pre></p>

More formally, the University regulations state that to complete a course or unit students shall attend prescribed classes, lectures, seminars and tutorials. Where a student, due to exceptional circumstances, is unable to attend a scheduled class, they are required to obtain prior approval of the unit coordinator to be absent from that class. Any student absent from class without having had such absence approved by the unit coordinator may be referred to the faculty for advice and may be required to withdraw from the unit.</p></pre></p>

It is important that the referencing of any sources used in your written work is done properly, if only to substantiate the points you are making in your assignment or project. The Harvard style is the preferred unless otherwise stated by the unit coordinator. There are some notes for guidance which have been prepared by the library staff: 'Citing your Sources Harvard Style' (<a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/harvard' target='_blank' >http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/harvard</a>).The EndNote software package is a really good system for building up a database of references. Not everyone will want to invest the time in using this system but you should consider it if you intend to build up resource materials or plan to undertake extensive research in a particular area. The library staff have also developed a tutoring package: A Quick Guide to Using EndNote which provides the basics for using EndNote with an essay <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote' target='_blank' >http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote</a>

Moderation of marks
The Business School must ensure that the processes of assessment are fair and are designed to maintain the standards of the School and its students. The School follows the UWA marks and grades distribution:
Higher distinction	(HD)	80-100%
Distinction	(D)	70-79%
Credit Pass	(CR)	60-69%
Pass	(P)	50-59%
Fail	(N+)	45-49%
Fail	(N)	0-44%
Failed component	(FC)
The moderation of marks to ensure comparability between classes is an acceptable academic practice. The School and Board of Examiners have the right to moderate marks where it is considered necessary to maintain consistency and fairness.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
