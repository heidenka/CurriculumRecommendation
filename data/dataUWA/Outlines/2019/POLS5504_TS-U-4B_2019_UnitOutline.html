The unit aims to reveal to students the politics, pressures, dynamics and challenges of working and leading in the contemporary public sector. The principal method for achieving this teaching and learning objective is through direct exposure to and engagement with a range of former and current public sector leaders, policy makers and senior practitioners in WA and Australia, who will be brought into the classroom to share their experiences, practices and insights with students. The unit builds upon and link theoretical and conceptual material in other Master of Public Policy units with the practical aspects of public sector leadership and policy making.</td>

The unit aims to reveal to students the politics, pressures, dynamics and challenges of working and leading in the contemporary public sector. The principal method for achieving this teaching and learning objective is through direct exposure to and engagement with a range of former and current public sector leaders, policy makers and senior practitioners in WA and Australia, who will be brought into the classroom to share their experiences, practices and insights with students. The unit builds upon and link theoretical and conceptual material in other Master of Public Policy units with the practical aspects of public sector leadership and policy making.

Learning outcomes
Students are able to: 
(1)	build knowledge of professional behaviour and enhance professional skills in communication and networking appropriate to the contemporary public sector; 
(2)	develop an advanced understanding of the practices and dynamics of contemporary public sector leadership and policy making; and
(3)	conduct and produce research on a major contemporary public sector leadership challenge.

Assessment 1: Career Biography (20%) Due on 29 August, assessed in Class

Having learned the theories and empirical studies of public sector leadership, the aim of this assessment is to connect acquired knowledge to the everyday realities of effective public sector leadership. It should help you to develop an advanced understanding of the practices and dynamics of contemporary public sector leadership and policy-making. You are expected to present an in-class powerpoint presentation of the career biography of a distinguished Australian public sector leader. The face-to-face interview will be conducted on UWA campus. Based on this interview, you are expected to lead and present a 30 min seminar on leadership. 

For this assessment, you are expected to identify a public leader and develop a list of open-ended interview questions that can begin with the following:

1.	Reasons for attraction to a career in public service; 
2.	Areas of responsibility in government; and 
3.	Educational training 

Below are the questions that can help you to choose topics of your specific interest:

1.	What are the set of attributes, from mindset to skills and practices/behaviors, did this leader identify as crucial for effective public sector leadership? Why?
2.	What did the leader identify as the enabling factors and challenges of effective public sector leadership, and why?
3.	How did the leader bring about a desired outcome? How did the leader secure buy-in from multiple stakeholders? 
4.	Did the leader apply the same leadership style in all situations? What style was this? Why? Or did the leader adapt to the environment? If so, what did they do differently, when, and why?
5.	How did the leader lead under a challenging situations e.g., a crisis, a public sector reform? Why?
6.	What are the leader’s insights on the contemporary challenges facing 21st Century public sector leaders in the social, economic, and political environment in which they operate? 

When presenting your interview findings in class, you should include an analysis of your interview findings. Specifically,
1.	Which of the interview findings support the leadership literature? How?
2.	Which of the interview findings further contribute to the leadership literature? How?
3.	Which of the interview findings challenge an existing leadership literature? How?


You will be assessed based on the following:
•	Content of presentation (weighting: 70% of total presentation mark)
•	Structure of presentation (weighting: 10% of total mark)
•	Strategies/aids used (weighting: 10% of total mark)
•	Approach (weighting: 10% of total mark)

Assessment 2: Minor essay (30%) 1000 words. Due on Tuesday 10 September, 2019, 4pm. Turnitin Submission

The goal of this assessment is to critically analyse TWO leadership theories/approaches covered in the seminars and readings. In critically analysing the leadership theories/approaches, you are expected to address the following questions for each theory/approach:

1.	What is it? What does it mean to you?
2.	Would you use it in the workplace? 
3.	Why would you use (or not use) it in the workplace? 
4.	How would you use it in the workplace? 
5.	How would you know whether your leadership approach(es) is/are working/not working? How would you evaluate your approaches?

This is not an opinion piece. You are required to provide evidence to support your arguments e.g., cite relevant empirical research. You are also encouraged to refer to relevant points raised during the interview with the public sector leaders and senior practitioners. Refer to the marking rubric for more information.

Assessment 3: Major essay (50%) 4000 words Due on Tuesday 22 October, 2019, 4pm, Turnitin submission.

The goal of this assessment is to apply what you have learned from the literature covered in the seminars and readings to analyse a case study. Choose ONE (1) of the ANZSOG case studies listed in LMS that is related to leadership. You can also choose another case study from the case library at ANZSOG (<a href='https://www.anzsog.edu.au/resource-library/case-library/the-case-program' target='_blank'>https://www.anzsog.edu.au/resource-library/case-library/the-case-program</a> ),

Your paper should be an analytical piece, not a descriptive piece of leadership. Always explain your statements/arguments clearly. Do not assume that the reader will ‘get you’ from a single sentence. Always back up your arguments with credible sources. Please also remember to balance your analytical coverage with depth. Refer to the marking rubric for more information.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
