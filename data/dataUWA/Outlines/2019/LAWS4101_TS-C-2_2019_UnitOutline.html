How is it interpreted and applied? It scrutinises the origins of our legal system and its place in the world. A major focus is our law-making institutions. The court structure, the role of judges and the doctrine of precedent are all considered, as are the functions of the legislature, the federal system and the principles of statutory interpretation. It also examines the critical role of the legal profession and the overarching importance of ethical practice and professional responsibility. The basics of legal research and writing are introduced. The ability to find the relevant law, to read cases and to interpret legislation are cultivated through in-class and out of class exercises. Proficiency in the critical lawyering skills of identifying the material facts and relevant legal principles in a particular situation, and marrying the two together to provide coherent and useful advice, are developed through problem-solving activities.</td>

Students will engage with critical and comparative legal thought (including Indigenous legal systems; structural, explicit and unconscious bias; legal histories and legal change); learn how to ‘think’ and ‘talk’ the law (including learning and applying legal reasoning and logic); understand how to find, analyse and interpret cases and legislation; and examine management of study, workload, wellbeing and their future careers. Much of the unit is taught through workshops where students are able to apply their knowledge and skills to a range of scenarios. </p></pre>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
