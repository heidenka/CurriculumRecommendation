Students are able to identify situations in which quantitative analysis can support problem solving and decision making. They also gain practical experience in applying statistical and decision analysis techniques and statistical packages (generally Excel) in management contexts. Topics include introduction to modelling of organisations and business problems, measurement, variability, uncertainty, statistical tests and quantitative approaches to decision making. The unit provides a foundation for quantitative techniques used in other master’s degree units.</td>

This anxiety is perfectly normal but as our journey progresses I'm 99% confident you'll feel more comfortable and see the topic's relevance to your field of study, workplace and everyday decision-making.

Learning data analysis is similar to learning a new language or skill; initially you may feel confused, even frustrated, but eventually through perseverance you'll understand how to apply the statistical tools discussed in class. For those with previous statistical experience, I hope the 'extra' activities developed for the unit will expand your knowledge and introduce applications to assist you to make better data-driven decisions.

I can't stress enough how important it is to keep up to speed with the content throughout the semester, as this is a scaffolding unit, with most topics covered building on the previous ones. To assist with this I've scheduled two in-class quizzes and a final exam. In teams, you will also complete a "Statistics in Practice" presentation, requiring you to analyse secondary dataset and present the findings in a non-technical way. All team members need to contribute to the presentation.  

Therefore, if you regularly read your textbook (I'll advise which sections are particularly relevant) and consistently work through recommended questions, your learning experience will be greatly enhanced. Please don't restrict your reading to your textbook - any article/journal that refers to statistics will add to your learning. If you feel overwhelmed at any stage, please don't hesitate to contact me so that we can work through your concerns together.

All material will be made available in LMS and I urge you to use this resource on a weekly basis. During class, I welcome discussion on how the subject matter relates to your experience. All the very best in both DADM and any other unit(s) you are studying in Semester 2, 2019. I look forward to meeting you soon.</p></pre>

                    <h3>Teaching and Learning Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>My teaching philosophy is encapsulated by the following quote - “When teaching, light a fire, don't fill a bucket” - Dan Snow

With teaching, my main goal is to inspire, to ‘light a fire’. I hope that you see real value in the learning material presented, understand the application of this material to your workplace and, as a result, seek more information on the topic. However, a unit such as this presents many difficulties. It may be that you attend the first class with misconceptions of the use of analytics, believing that there is little application for this knowledge in management. Additionally, many of you may have little or no background in analytics and, therefore, are very nervous and concerned about studying 'data analytics'. I firmly believe that engaging and encouraging you to participate in each topic provides a more conducive learning environment than simply bombarding you with information or ‘filling your buckets’. To inspire you, and help overcome your apprehension, I encourage both critical thinking and the linking of theory to real-world examples. In doing this, I present newspaper articles, business reports, reports from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and case studies to demonstrate the application of certain statistical output. I also have you critically appraise such material. However, to ensure this approach is successful, I present theories, models, and research in such a way that allows you to draw on your own working experiences and relate these experiences to each topic. I reinforce this with a Statistics in Practice presentation involving the analysis of workplace data. You are required to analyse the secondary data provided and communicate your findings as a team presentation. This ‘hands-on’ approach helps to reinforce learning and understanding of each topic. It also provides a useful framework for those who initially may not see the application of business analytics to the workplace.

Several different activities have been included in the DADM unit to make your learning easier, more engaging and stimulating. The aim is to provide you with a "toolkit" for data analysis and decision-making in a range of scenarios, including your field of study, workplace and everyday decision-making. Lectures will include discussion of case studies or reports demonstrating the use of a particular technique, plus practical hands-on sessions to reinforce the elements required for each topic. This, combined with your accumulated knowledge, experience and ideas, will reap dividends when it comes to your project and problem-solving.

Any person operating in a business, management or marketing environment requires as much information as possible about that environment. In everyday life, we're confronted with data - often unknowingly - and make decisions based on that. It's therefore important to know how to correctly interpret the information hidden in data to help make sound decisions. This unit focuses on the processes of data collection, analysis (mainly quantitative data but occasionally qualitative), interpretation, presentation, and how these tasks assist decision-making. The main focus is on interpreting the results of data analysis and developing decision strategies based on these results rather than generating data itself. However, an ability to convert data into meaningful statistical output is a very useful skill. It cannot be emphasised enough that this unit is NOT designed to convert you into a data scientist (we cover very little mathematics), but instead to give you an appreciation of the various uses of readily available data. At the same time, you'll learn about several analytical models and natural “laws” that build the foundations for more advanced techniques encountered in other Business Masters' units. All the very best in both 3D and any other unit(s) you are studying in 2019. I look forward to meeting you very soon.</p></pre>

More formally, the University regulations state that to complete a course or unit students shall attend prescribed classes, lectures, seminars and tutorials. Where a student, due to exceptional circumstances, is unable to attend a scheduled class, they are required to obtain prior approval of the unit coordinator to be absent from that class. Any student absent from class without having had such absence approved by the unit coordinator may be referred to the faculty for advice and may be required to withdraw from the unit.</p></pre>
                    <h3>Referencing Requirements</h3>

The Harvard style is the preferred used unless otherwise stated by the unit coordinator. There are some notes for guidance which have been prepared by the library staff: 'Citing your Sources Harvard Style' (<a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/harvard' target='_blank'>http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/harvard</a>) . The EndNote software package is a really good system for building up a database of references. Not everyone will want to invest the time in using this system but you should consider it if you intend to build up resource materials or plan to undertake extensive research in a particular area. The library staff have also developed a tutoring package: A Quick Guide to Using EndNote which provides the basics for using EndNote with an essay <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote' target='_blank'>http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote</a>

Please ensure you have access to the following textbook which will be referred to throughout the course: 
Jaggia, Kelly, Salzman, Olaru, Srianathakumar, Beg & Leighton 2016, Essentials of Business Statistics: Communicating with Numbers, McGraw-Hill Education (Australia) Pty Ltd. ISBN 9781743769324. 

Resources for this unit (including PowerPoint slides, practice exam papers, assignment examples) will be available on LMS and can be accessed through the following website: <a href='https://lms.uwa.edu.au' target='_blank'>https://lms.uwa.edu.au</a> 

McGraw-Hill Connect Business Statistics 
Please note: Your book purchase includes access to Connect Business Statistics by MCGraw-Hill. This package gives you access to many tools and resources to enhance your learning of the topics in this unit. The package includes MS Excel datasets, guided examples and Learnsmart which provides an excellent self-guided learning program for each topic. There are many additional resources with Connect which are discussed in the textbook. 

Suggested alternate texts 
The UWA has "pre-loved" statistics textbooks waiting to find another home or you may have friends or family members having one already. There is also a rich collection of stats books in the Reid Library and the Barry Marshall Science Library. You may find one of these is a useful complement to your prescribed textbook. While the fundamental concepts are the same, the alternate texts do not have the Connect code. You may use them but need to purchase the access code for Connect. I'll also post relevant statistically themed articles on LMS from time to time.

Software requirements 
Being familiar with statistical software packages, in this case Excel, is a vital part of maximising your learning experience. Having both a competency and confidence using Excel will enable you to analyse large files of data without having to worry about cumbersome mathematical formulae, as well as assist with your "Statistics in Practice" project. This unit will use Excel; a prior knowledge of this software is desirable but NOT essential. The textbook provides instructions on how to use specific features of Excel and regular demonstrations in class will aim to increase students' familiarity with the package. However, students are welcome to use a statistical package (e.g. SPSS, SAS, R, MATLAB) of their choice for analysis, if they have access to it. 

Calculator Requirements
As the unit emphasis is on interpretation of output, there is no need to purchase a sophisticated scientific calculator. A standard, UWA-approved Casio or Sharp scientific calculator is more than enough, in fact for the exam a simple calculator with the basic arithmetic operations will suffice, if needed at all (the exam is practical, so you are expected to use Excel for all calculations). However, if you want to use a calculator, you will need to get it "approved" at the Business School office prior to the final exam (the UWA sticker is the confirmation, please see below).

Additional resources and reading 
Any statistics/data analysis textbook available in UWA libraries will assist you with the unit's subject matter. We'll use databases from the textbook, provided by the lecturer, or obtained from the Business section of the Library. </p></pre>

Moderation of marks
The Business School must ensure that the processes of assessment are fair and are designed to maintain the standards of the School and its students. The School follows the UWA marks and grades distribution:

Higher distinction	(HD)	80-100%
Distinction	(D)	70-79%
Credit Pass	(CR)	60-69%
Pass	(P)	50-59%
Fail	(N+)	45-49%
Fail	(N)	0-44%
Failed component	(FC)	
The moderation of marks to ensure comparability between classes is an acceptable academic practice. The School and Board of Examiners have the right to moderate marks where it is considered necessary to maintain consistency and fairness.

Charter of student rights and responsibilities
The Charter of Student Rights and Responsibilities upholds the fundamental rights of students who undertake their education at the University of Western Australia. The University's charter of Student Rights and Responsibilities is available at www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP07/132

Information for students with disabilities
The University has a range of support services, equipment and facilities for students with a disability. If you would like to receive advice on these services please email uniaccess@uwa.edu.au or visit www.uniaccess.uwa.edu.au

Using peer feedback to assess team contributions
The online tool SPARKPLUS may be to used to assess individual contributions to team work. You may be required to provide feedback to, and receive feedback from, your team members. Based on a series of answers from each team member SPARKPLUS automatically produces two weighting factors: your RPF and SAPA. The use of SPARKPLUS will be explained in class and more information is available on LMS.

Quality assurance
Your assessed work may also be used for quality assurance purposes, such as to assess the level of achievement of learning outcomes as required for accreditation and audit purposes. The findings may be used to inform changes aimed at improving the quality of Business School programs. All material used for such processes will be treated as confidential, and the outcome will not affect your grade for the unit.

Approved calculators for examinations
The University permits only the use of calculators in examinations when the calculator has an approved sticker and the examiner permits their use. If the student does not have an approved sticker on their calculator, they will not be permitted to use the calculator. Calculators can be approved at the Undergraduate Student Centre, the Postgraduate Student Centre or at Student Administration. Further information is available on the Business School website at www.business.uwa.edu.au/students/assessments

eBooks and open book exams
eBooks cannot be accessed at an examination. Please check your exam details and purchase a printed version of any book you would select to take into an open book exam.</p></pre>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
