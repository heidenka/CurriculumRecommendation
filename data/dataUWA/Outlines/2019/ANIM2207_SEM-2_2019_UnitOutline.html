This unit builds on knowledge of the diversity of animals and interprets the differences and similarities within the framework of their evolutionary relationships to each other. While sometimes very different, animals provide many fascinating examples of solutions to the problems of gaining nutrients, removing wastes and surviving to reproduce the next generation. The unit provides a broad overview of animal function and structure and integrates this information with that introduced in earlier units of the major. It is a step leading to the units of Level 3 of the major where the underlying fundamental mechanisms and processes are revealed.</p></pre>

A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.

For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).

If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.

If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;


Academic conduct

Academic Integrity is defined in the University Policy on Academic Conduct as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.

Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.

Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding academic conduct and ethical scholarship at UWA.

Special Considerations

If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:

serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend
serious injury
being a victim of a crime
breakdown of relationship
sudden loss of income or employment
serious disruption to domestic arrangements
