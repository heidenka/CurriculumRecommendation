They are introduced to theories of ethics and social justice in early childhood education and care settings and utilise best practices when conducting research with children and their families. Students apply a bio-ecological system in practice—utilising information exchange with parents, peers, university staff and other professionals in the field of early childhood education and care. Students are introduced to assessment and rating in education and care services as per the regulatory authorities' assessment against the National Quality Standard and apply an international Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (ECERS). Students critically evaluate theoretical and research literature and global and national policy developments. Students learn how to create rich numeracy learning environments.</td>

We discuss, analysis and measure international and national ideas on ECEC quality. We explore social justice theories and learn ways to incorporate these ideas into how services for children and their families are run. Students learn how to completely change service provision to optimise every child's potential through play based activities. 

Students are introduced to Assessment and Rating in Education and Care services as per the regulatory authorities' assessment against the National Quality Standard and apply an international Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (ECERS). Students critically evaluate theoretical and research literature and global and national policy developments. Students learn how to create rich numeracy learning environments.</p></pre>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre>

Multi-mode with face to face classes and an online component.

The following teaching and learning strategies may be used in this unit: lecture, presentation, debates, small and large group discussion as well as strategies such as formative assessment and sharing of ideas and quickwrites to help students develop a deeper understanding of the concepts and theories presented in the weekly lecture and required readings. We will conduct on-site visits to ensure that students gain a deep understanding of how to provide an assess quality ECEC environments.

The following resources may be used in this unit: textbooks, peer-reviewed articles, video clips, ICT and lecturer/tutor created resources.</p></pre>

This unit meets the requirements of ACECQA. Lectures and  Workshops will explore a range of indoor and outdoor learning environments, discussions and activities associated with assessment. Through this model a student-centred learning environment will be developed, where all students are encouraged and expected to contribute. Certain field-trips are delivered outside the university in early learning centres. This structure has been employed to allow students the opportunity to integrate theory with practice in relation to developing effective learning environments.</p></pre>

                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>

                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
