The media are correctly perceived to have great power in shaping public policy and moulding public attitudes on a wide range of issues. However, while the media's power is undeniable, one should not disregard the influence over the media of other actors, notably the government. The unit examines the interaction between the media and the government in affecting public opinion and policies. It covers key issues such as the nature of, and forces producing, news; media cultures and organisational settings which shape the way journalists report politics; and the relationship of media to the processes of government, including agenda setting, policy formation and policy implementation. It analyses cases from Australia and overseas in order to provide students with a better understanding of how and why the media game is played.</td>

The media are correctly perceived to have great power in shaping public policy and moulding public attitudes on a wide range of issues. However, while the media's power is undeniable, one should not disregard the influence over the media of other actors, notably the government. The unit examines the interaction between the media and the government in affecting public opinion and policies. It covers key issues such as the nature of, and forces producing, news; media cultures and organisational settings which shape the way journalists report politics; and the relationship of media to the processes of government, including agenda setting, policy formation and policy implementation. It analyses cases from Australia and overseas in order to provide students with a better understanding of how and why the media game is played.</p></pre>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
