As the timetable is quite complex and varies from week to week, a separate detailed timetable document has been prepared for you to view the weekly unit schedule.  Please check the weekly timetable for each venue on the unit’s LMS page.

Large Group Learning – Lectures                                                                                                                   
Throughout the week there are a number of lecture sessions.  They occur in similar blocks of time over the course of the week with an average of 8 lectures per week. However, you will need to look at the detailed unit timetable (a separate document) to see when and where the lectures are scheduled in any given week.  As this is not an on-line course attendance is highly recommended and while lecturers usually give permission for their lecture to be recorded and their notes posted on the LMS, a guarantee cannot be given.  Occasionally the technology will fail and the lecture not recorded; this technical failure is irretrievable.  Personal audio or visual recording of lectures is not permitted. Each lecturer will contribute content to a pool of questions from which assessment items are selected. 
Please remember that unlike most undergraduate degrees where the majority of teaching is done by a small group of university academics, this is a post-graduate professional degree where much of the teaching is done by busy, practising medical specialists who are volunteering their time. Every effort is made to ensure that these teachers are reminded of their teaching sessions but on occasion, due to unforeseen circumstances, non-attendance of a teacher will occur. Missed sessions will be rescheduled where possible if the Unit Coordinator is notified in a timely manner. Most teachers will provide copies of their PowerPoint presentations for uploading to the LMS and where possible these will be made available before the teaching session.

Laboratory/E-learning Sessions
As for semester 1, you will be working in medium sized labs and/or e-learning sessions in some weeks.  You attend one of each laboratory/e-learning session type in the week of the particular rotation. See note on attendance on page 11 of the unit guide)

Laboratory Classes – Conduct and Safety

Attendance
Attendance at laboratory classes is compulsory.  If a student is absent from a laboratory class, he or she must present a doctor’s certificate to the unit coordinator as outlined earlier. 

Preparation for the Laboratory
You are expected to come to the laboratory session having done the preparation that is required for the session.  That includes being familiar with the aims/purpose of the work to be done in the session, the methods and equipment that will be used, and having done the reading or other preparation that has been asked of you, including understanding the background theory behind the session. 



Equipment
Bring with you to the session all equipment you will need including - calculator, pen, ruler, felt pen (indelible), laboratory manual, laboratory coat, closed-in shoes.

Fire
Be aware of the location of fire blankets and fire extinguishers adjacent to the laboratory. 
The continuous sounding of the FIRE ALARM or evacuation SIREN signals that an emergency evacuation should commence. All students need to make their way to the nearest exit in a quiet, orderly fashion and assemble at the evacuation assembly point so that it can be ascertained that all students have in fact left the building.  Please familiarise yourself with the location of exits to the buildings in which laboratories are held. 

Conduct and Safety in the Laboratory 
You should observe the following rules. Students who compromise the functioning and safety of the laboratory sessions by not following these instructions will be asked to leave the class.  There will no opportunity to make up the learning session at a later date. 

1.	Laboratory coats, gloves and closed-in shoes worn at all sessions
For safety reasons, laboratory coats (worn buttoned up) and closed-in shoes are compulsory for ALL laboratories in the course.  Students must supply their own laboratory coat; they can be purchased from UWA Guild.  Students without a laboratory coat or closed-in shoes will not be permitted to participate in the laboratory session, and therefore will be marked as absent.  No sandals, thongs are permitted.
Wear long hair tied back away from the face and tucked into your lab coat.
Your name tag is to be visually displayed. 
Disposable gloves should be worn especially when dealing with chemicals, blood and body fluids.  Protective eyewear should also be worn when handling chemical solutions, blood or body fluids. 
2.	No Food or Drink (including water) to be brought into or consumed the laboratory.  Bring only what is needed into the laboratory.
3.	No running in the laboratory. 
4.	Clean up any spillage and report any breakages
Any spillage needs to be reported and cleaned up immediately. Spillages of biological material (i.e. blood) must be wiped up using the disinfectant solution provided. Any breakage needs to be reported to the laboratory technician or demonstrator. 
5.	Clean up at the end of the session
At the end of the session, students need to remove any waste, liquid and solid from their set up and must inspect the work area to ensure that it is left in a satisfactory state (clean and tidy). Waste is to be placed in the specially marked bins provided and all paper waste to be placed in the rubbish bins in the laboratory. Never remove material from the laboratory.
6.	Wash your hands thoroughly when you leave the laboratory or at any time you believe they have become contaminated. 

Safety Procedures for Handling Potentially Infectious Materials

All biological materials (Human blood, blood products and Urine) should be treated as potentially infectious/hazardous. 

Some laboratories may involve the collection of student blood and urine samples.  Any student knowing they are a carrier of blood borne infections, needs to contact the Faculty to discuss the risks involved. 

When handling biological materials please observe the following safety procedures:
1.	Wear the laboratory coat buttoned up
2.	Wear closed-in shoes – not sandals or thongs
3.	Wear long hair tied back away from the face
4.	Wear disposable gloves (provided by the laboratory)
5.	Wear protective glasses (provided by the laboratory)
6.	Inform the laboratory technician or demonstrator of the presence of broken skin on the hands (cover with Band-Aid/dressing and gloves. If extensive the student should not participate)
7.	Do not touch face, mouth or eyes
8.	Do not consume food or drink in the laboratory
9.	Do not do anything that will cause blood to splash or aerosolise
10.	Dispose of sharps promptly into the appropriate sharps containers
11.	Report immediately to the demonstrator any incident involving blood (i.e. spillage, contamination of skin, eyes or mouth)

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
