The first segment of the unit establishes a basic understanding of the nature of technology and innovation. The second segment deals with the management of innovative projects—the vehicle of change. The third segment of the unit deals with strategic aspects of technology and innovation, establishing a stream of innovations to maintain a competitive edge.</td>

They are both critical to establishing a sustainable competitive edge through either differentiation or a superior cost position. This unit provides students with a strategic perspective on the role of technology and innovation in organisations and also with practical management tools that they can use to manage specific innovations and technological changes. The first segment of the unit establishes a basic understanding of the nature of technology and innovation. The second segment deals with the management of innovative projects—the vehicle of change. The third segment of the unit deals with strategic aspects of technology and innovation, establishing a stream of innovations to maintain a competitive edge.

Introduction:

MKTG5603: Management of Technology and Innovation (MOTI) focuses on the process of how firms manage innovation and the processes of new product development (NPD) and commercialisation. It seeks to adopt an applied approach to the subject and to allow students the opportunity to work with actual firms and innovations.

The process of commercialising a new product or technology has been likened to the “crossing of a chasm”. Just because you have a really wonderful new mouse trap does not mean that the market will adopt it. To get your innovation into mainstream production requires careful analysis of the most appropriate pathway to market, and the design of an appropriate business case that will create an investment vehicle for potential investors.

There is evidence that a positive relationship exists between the level of innovation (as measured by patents lodged), the overall productivity of the workforce, and the general growth of the Australian economy. However, while the track record of invention within Australia is impressive, the rate of successful commercialisation of this intellectual property is poor.

Common problems associated with commercialisation failures are, poor or inappropriate business models; inadequate management skills by those seeking to develop the venture; insufficient marketing and market assessment; poor management of intellectual property; absence of a clear exit strategy and inadequate understanding of the venture capital process.

Successful commercialisation requires several stages through which the new technology or innovation must pass. While each commercialisation project is frequently unique, there are several key factors that have been found to be most important to commercialisation success. The first of these is to have a clearly defined market for the new innovation. Second, there must be a well-balanced management or project development team capable of handling the engineering, production, marketing, financial and strategic management tasks associated with a new product development process. This team must be able to assess and control risk, both financial and technical, and it should be able to listen to the voice of the customer, adapting the product or process to suit market requirements.

Finally, the team needs to be able to secure resources to enable it to bring the project to the market. Raising finance to fuel business development requires the ability to prepare an investment ready business case, protect intellectual property, and negotiate suitable contracts.

Unit content:

The unit focuses on the theory and practice of innovation management, NPD and commercialisation. It draws together concepts and methods that have been identified as forming "best practice" in these areas. Topics covered include: i) the design of sustainable business models for new products and innovations; ii) assessing the market and listening to the voice of the customer; iii) assessing the resource capabilities of the firm for commercialisation and whether there is a requirement for strategic partnerships; iv) the identification and protection of intellectual property (IP) rights and the ability to create other sources of "isolating mechanisms"; v) assessement of the financial case for undertaking the commercialisation of the innovation and alternative sources of financing; vi) assessment of the technical case for the commercialisation of the innovation; and vii) developing a commercialisation strategy for the innovation.

Unit goals:

The principal aim of this unit is to familiarise students with the theory and practice of innovation management, new product development and commercialisation of innovation. It is designed to be an applied program with students having the opportunity to engage in action learning tasks with live projects and firms. It is targeted at students who wish to understand the process of commercialisation and the practical challenges of new product development.

Students who are interested in working with companies in the innovation management and commercialisation area will gain benefit from taking the unit. For managers working within larger organisations the unit should provide some valuable insights in to the nature of commercialisation and innovation management. For students who seek to launch their own entrepreneurial ventures the unit will provide some important tools and knowledge for how to undertake the process.

Lecture Capture System:

Lecture Capture System(LCS) is not implemented for this unit due to the highly interactive teaching style.</p></pre>
                    <h3>Lecture Capture System</h3>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre>

The intensive delivery mode for the unit is designed to facilitate the industry project owners to participate, and to undertake the classes as an applied workshop. Students will work in teams and will be expected to have undertaken the reading and preparation for the workshops before coming to the classes.

There will also be a requirement and an expectation that students will maintain contact with the industry project owner during the weeks in-between the workshops in order to complete the learning tasks and assignments. A period of approximately 4 weeks has been provided between each teaching workshop block to enable sufficient time to undertake the assignments.

Teaching and Learning Evaluation:

You may be asked to complete two evaluations during this unit: The Student Perception of Teaching (SPOT) and the Students’ Unit Reflective Feedback (SURF). The SPOT is optional and is an evaluation of the lecturer and the unit. The SURF is completed online and is a university wide survey and deals only with the unit. You will receive an email inviting you to complete the SURF when it is activated. We encourage you to complete the forms as your feedback is extremely important and can be used to make changes to the unit or lecturing style when appropriate.</p></pre>

There are some notes for guidance which have been prepared by the library staff: ‘APA citation style: Introduction' see: <a href='https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/apa' target='_blank'>https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/apa</a>. 

The EndNote software package is a really good system for building up a database of references. Not everyone will want to invest the time in using this system but you should consider it if you intend to build up resource materials or plan to undertake extensive research in a particular area. The library staff have also developed a tutoring package: ‘A Quick Guide to Using EndNote’ which provides the basics for using EndNote with an essay <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote' target='_blank'>http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote</a></p></pre>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
