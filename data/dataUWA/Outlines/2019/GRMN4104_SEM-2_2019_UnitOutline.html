The academic objectives of the unit are to (1) further advance competency in written composition of the German language; (2) develop and strengthen the independent learning and research skills necessary for postgraduate studies; (3) develop skills in reading, analysing and producing different types of discursive texts by exercises in reformulation and paraphrase, textual cohesion and coherence, summarising, synthesising, composition of newspaper articles, book and film reviews, and editorials; (4) further students' knowledge of contemporary German society and culture; (5) reflect critically on a wide variety of topical subjects; and (6) bring students' proficiency of oral and written German up to the advanced level of C1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Gemeinsamer Europaischer Referenzrahmen).</td>

While the range of teaching and learning activities in the unit are intended to strengthen students' grasp of German discursive practices and methods of argumentation, they also expand knowledge of contemporary German-speaking societies and cultures. 

The academic objectives of the unit are to (1) further advance competency in written composition of the German language; (2) develop and strengthen the independent learning and research skills necessary for postgraduate studies; (3) develop skills in reading, analysing and producing different types of discursive texts by exercises in reformulation and paraphrase, textual cohesion and coherence, summarising, synthesising, composition of newspaper articles, book and film reviews, and editorials; (4) further students' knowledge of contemporary German society and culture; (5) reflect critically on a wide variety of topical subjects; and (6) bring students' proficiency of oral and written German up to the advanced level of C1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Gemeinsamer Europaischer Referenzrahmen).</p></pre>

Its focus is on particular aspects of language study such as the evaluation of translation quality and scrutinization of arguments through the study of newspaper articles (mainly from literaturkritik.de), intensive translation analysis (mainly from 20th century classics), the development of advanced reading skills, as well as techniques of (journalistic) writing.


Each text will have been chosen to illustrate a specific area of language use (e.g. reported speech, syntax, tenses or collocations), a specific area of translation practice (e.g. accuracy, audience, explicitness and appropriateness), or a specific area of contrastive study (e.g. culture, perspective and register).</p></pre>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
