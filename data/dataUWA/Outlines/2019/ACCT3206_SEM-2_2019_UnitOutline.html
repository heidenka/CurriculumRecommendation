                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>In this unit, I value participation highly. I want you to think about
the content, discuss it with each other, and come to a better
understanding through the discussion. The goal of this unit is that at
the end of the semester you are able to read and understand a research
paper in management accounting which gives you a great insight in how
firms use incentives and measurement as part of managing employees. In
addition, this unit will develop your ability to present, read,
understand, and critically evaluate a technical report. These skills
are invaluable no matter whether you want to start a career in
accounting, the resources sector, the government, or (dare I say it?)
academia.

                    <h3>Unit Structure</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>The material and the assessment mechanism reflects these goals. The
bulk of the work in the workshop revolves around 11 research
papers. All presentations, discussions, and final exam questions will
be centered around those 11 papers. As a result, you have to have read
the research paper before the workshop. That does not mean that you
have to understand the paper perfectly. After a first reading, you
should get the main message of the paper and roughly understand where
the researchers get their facts from. I am not interested in the
details of the statistical analysis. Typically, you can understand the
results from what the papers will call the descriptive statistics or
from the figures. To make sure you have read the paper, in at least 3
of the workshops, you will have to answer a multiple choice test with
simple questions about the research paper of that week. This is the
first assessment item.

The next step in understanding the research paper better is that each
week some of you will present the key parts of the paper. This is the
second assessment item. In the second half of each workshop, we will
discuss three or four questions about the paper. I will assess your
participation when we discuss these questions in the workshop. After
the workshop, you can further discuss the paper and the questions on
the unit's blog. Your participation (online and in the workshop) is
the third assessment item.

Some of the workshop questions will come back on the final exam, the
last assessment item. Since the final exam is open book, I will not
provide you with the exam answers to the questions.

I understand that this unit requires a lot of preparation during the
semester. However, this is compensated by the fact that your
preparation will immediately pay-off in your assessment for the
multiple choice questions and the class participation. Your reward in
the longer term is that all questions on the final exam deal with the
same research papers that we discuss during the workshops.

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>- I will start the second half of some randomly chosen workshops with a
multiple choice test about the article. In such a test, there will be
five questions. If you get a question correct, you get 1 mark,
otherwise you will have 0. There will be at least 3 of these tests
during the semester. The average of your best two scores will count
towards 5% of your total mark.

- In the second half of the workshop, we will discuss the
questions that I put up before the workshop. Those questions can be
found at the end of each lecture in these lecture notes. 25% of your
total marks will depend on your participation during the workshop. I
will take notes every week after the workshop. If you have said
something (an answer, a question, a remark, a reaction to somebody
else's answer), I will take note of that. At the end of the unit, I
will transform your score for workshop participation to a mark on 25,
the workshop participation mark. The transformation is a logarithmic
function. This means that your first comment will lead to a larger
increase in your participation mark than your fifth comment.

You can also earn your participation marks by discussing the lectures
and workshops on the blog. I will calculate a score where every
comment by you on a blog entry counts for 1 point and every new
comment by you on the same blog entry counts for 1/3 points. I count
almost every comment except very short ones like "Thank you". This
does not mean that you cannot thank other people for a good answer, a
comment or a question but they will not count towards your marks. I
will also penalise students who split up their summaries over more
than two comments. They are fairly easy to identify for me. In
general, if you try to game the system I will make a correction to the
rules above. The points you gather for online comments will also be
transformed to a mark on 25, the online participation mark.

You can keep commenting on the blog during the semester until the day
before the final exam. However, comments made after the end of the
final week of teaching will only count towards 50% of the normal
points. Your comments are meant to stimulate and engage other
students. If you only add your comments late in the semester not
everyone will be able to benefit. Hence, I will reward comments more
if they are made during the teaching period.

Finally, I will also calculate a weighted average of the online and
the workshop participation, the /mixed participation mark/. Your final
score for your participation mark will be the maximum of the three
participation marks, i.e. workshop, online, and mixed.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
