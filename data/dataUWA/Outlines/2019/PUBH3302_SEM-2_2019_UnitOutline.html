Students have the opportunity to develop a health program using a planning and evaluation framework together with an overview of behavioural and social ecological models relevant to health promotion. The emphasis is on the prevention of chronic diseases which are strongly influenced by individual lifestyles and the changing social and economic environment. Students are involved in designing and implementing a small intervention on campus during the semester. Topics covered include understanding health behaviour, health promotion planning and evaluation, selection of target groups and settings and an introduction to commonly used health promotion strategies.</td>

                    <p>PUBH3302 - PUBH3302_SEM-2-2019_2019 - SEM-2-2019 - 2019 - Face to face / Blended learning</p>
                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>This unit provides an introduction to health promotion strategies and interventions that take into account individual, social and environmental determinants of health and examines several approaches to influencing behaviour. Students have the opportunity to develop a health program using a planning and evaluation framework together with an overview of behavioural and social ecological models relevant to health promotion. The emphasis is on the prevention of chronic diseases which are strongly influenced by individual lifestyles and the changing social and economic environment. Students are involved in designing and implementing a small intervention on campus during the semester. Topics covered include understanding health behaviour, health promotion planning and evaluation, selection of target groups and settings and an introduction to commonly used health promotion strategies.</p></pre>
                    <h3>Lecture Capture System</h3>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre>

Students will assume responsibility for the organisation of tutorial activities and allocation of appropriate tasks as well as the completion of these activities throughout semester. Tutors in PUBH3302 are experienced health promotion professionals, whose role will be to mentor tutorial groups through the course. As tutorial group members will be responsible for conducting tutorials, the role of the tutor will be to provide advice and guidance on the different components of the tutorial program. </p></pre>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
