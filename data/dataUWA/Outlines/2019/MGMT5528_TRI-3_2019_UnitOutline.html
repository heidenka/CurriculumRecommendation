                                    <td>This highly interactive experiential unit aims to enhance students' personal effectiveness and to develop foundation leadership capabilities. The unit is underpinned by positive psychology principles as well as a contemporary model of work behaviour that identifies the importance of mastery, agility and proactivity for success in today's complex and changing organisations. In Part 1—Leading Self, reflective activities are used to develop students' personal mastery (e.g. knowing one's strengths/limitations, goal setting, time management), agility (e.g. coping with change, being resilient) and proactivity (e.g. being creative, taking charge, design thinking).  In Part 2—Leading Others, practical activities and simulations are used to enhance students' ability to promote mastery, agility and proactivity in others via transactional and transformational leadership. The course is designed and run via the UWA's Accelerated Learning Laboratory.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>The unit is designed to be both evidence-based and practical. It is designed to help you develop and practice core self-management and leadership skills.
An important element of the program is its focus on enhancing your self-awareness. Research shows that individuals who are self-aware are better performers and leaders. Self-awareness also means you are more likely to lead a meaningful and fulfilling life. Raising self-awareness is therefore a core goal of the course. A further emphasis in this course is on learning practical people skills. The program is highly experiential and skills-oriented, which commentators have argued is important in MBA programs. For example: As well developing the ‘knowing’ component… “attention needs to be paid to developing the skills, capabilities, & techniques that lie at the heart of the practice of management (the “doing” component), and the values, attitudes, and beliefs that form managers’ world views and professional identities (the “being” component)” (Datar et al., 2010).
Australian-based analyses have identified the need for greater development of core practical competencies in management education: Practising managers see critical interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence, change management and ethics/CSR capabilities as major developmental needs in current managers …[they] see these same critical capabilities as lacking in [Australian] MBA programs (Financial Review, Australia’s top MBA programs, 2011)
Beyond management education, there has been increasing recognition about the importance of developing interpersonal and psychological capabilities to facilitate personal and career success in areas such as positive psychology.
A final important element of this course is that it is underpinned by solid evidence. Thus, whilst it is practical and experiential, the activities and ideas are grounded in research, and the assessments are psychometrically valid.

Unit goals:
In this unit, you will:
(1) build your self awareness;
(2) develop your personal mastery, agility, and proactivity; and
(3) develop your ability and understanding regarding how to promote these behaviors in others through effective leadership.

Lecture Capture System:
LCS is not implemented for this unit due to the highly interactive teaching style.</p></pre>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre>
                    <h3>Teaching and Learning Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>This unit has been developed to maximise your learning through experiential and reflective activities. The unit is probably for you if:

    You want to know more about yourself
    You want to create a more self-aware, flexible, and happier version of you
    You want to live a meaningful work life
    You want to understand how to lead, with or without authority
    You are open and willing to be challenged to try new things 

As Herbert Otto astutely commented, personal development and growth will only happen if you are willing to try new behaviours: “change and growth take place when a person has risked himself and dares to become involved with experimenting with his own life”. Throughout Leading Self and Leading Others, we encourage you to try new behaviours and be open to experimenting.
This unit is probably not for you if you believe that "good education equals good grades". It is fine to want good grades and we encourage you to work hard to do your best. But we also believe that good education is about personal growth and learning. We have designed this unit to be a pass/fail unit so you can fully concentrate on your personal development.
But just because the unit is pass/ fail, please don't assume it is an easy ride! We expect a lot from you in this unit because we know that full engagement and participation is the only way to progress your development.

Teaching and Learning Evaluation:
You may be asked to complete two evaluations during this unit: The Student Perception of Teaching (SPOT) and the Students’ Unit Reflective Feedback (SURF). The SPOT is optional and is an evaluation of the lecturer and the unit. The SURF is completed online and is a university wide survey and deals only with the unit. You will receive an email inviting you to complete the SURF when it is activated. We encourage you to complete the forms as your feedback is extremely important and can be used to make changes to the unit or lecturing style when appropriate.</p></pre>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>Lectures are on Tuesdays 6:00pm to 9:00pm throughout Trimester 2.  Please check timetable on the UWA Business School website: <a href='http://www.business.uwa.edu.au/students/timetables' target='_blank'>http://www.business.uwa.edu.au/students/timetables</a>

Leading Self & Leading Others consists of two parts: (1) Leading Self and (2) Leading Others.
In Leading Self, the unit aims to support your development so you can deal with challenges associated with “managing oneself”, such as knowing your strengths and being able to cope with setbacks and disappointments. Research shows that MBA students often struggle with these types of issues within their career. We focus on what scholars have identified as “investment traits”, or ways of doing things and mindsets that predict achievement, academic, and career success.
The evidence-based model that underpins the course is the Work Role Performance Model developed by Griffin, Neal and Parker, 2007. Thus, in Leading Self, we focus on developing three types of capabilities that are important for personal effectiveness: mastery, agility, and proactivity.

Mastery refers to effectively executing core and readily predictable technical and interpersonal capabilities, such as managing your time, being self-aware, and knowing your strengths.
Agility means you can cope with change whilst also maintaining your well-being. As result of technological, economic, and societal change, work has become more dynamic and unpredictable, which means it is vitally important that we can go beyond mastery of known tasks to also respond positively and flexibly to changing tasks, that is, to demonstrate agility.
Proactivity means you are able to self-start improvements, innovate, and create new directions. In other words, even agility is not enough. The dynamic nature of modern organisations means that success comes when individuals not only respond positively to change, but also initiate change. 

In Leading Others, we focus on managing and leading others even when you are not in a formal position of authority.
In this part of the program, we focus on developing your capabilities to cultivate the mastery, agility, and proactivity of others:

Leading for mastery captures the core management skills, sometimes referred to as transactional leadership, such as being clear about expectations and giving others' effective feedback. These sorts of leadership behaviours promote staff members' effectiveness in their core jobs (mastery).
Leading for agility focuses on those leader actions that will enable others to better cope with change. This includes more transformational leader behaviours, such as individualised consideration in the form of support and coaching.
Leading for proactivity also involves transformational leadership, especially inspirational motivation, vision, and empowerment. These leader behaviours stimulate staff members' willingness to be creative and to self-initiate change. 

You will also receive throughout the unit feedback on aspects of your personality, as well as aspects of your work environment, that influence and shape your leadership capabilities.
Note that places in the unit are limited so we can keep the classes small. Please enrol as early as possible.</p></pre>

More formally, the University regulations state that ‘to complete a course or unit students shall attend prescribed classes, lectures, seminars and tutorials’. Where a student, due to exceptional circumstances, is unable to attend a scheduled class, they are required to obtain prior approval of the unit coordinator to be absent from that class. Any student absent from class without having had such absence approved by the unit coordinator may be referred to the faculty for advice and may be required to withdraw from the unit.</p></pre>

The Harvard style is the preferred used unless otherwise stated by the unit coordinator. There are some notes for guidance which have been prepared by the library staff: ‘Citing your Sources Harvard Style’ . The EndNote software package is a really good system for building up a database of references. Not everyone will want to invest the time in using this system but you should consider it if you intend to build up resource materials or plan to undertake extensive research in a particular area. The library staff have also developed a tutoring package: ‘A Quick Guide to Using EndNote’ which provides the basics for using EndNote with an essay <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote' target='_blank'>http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote</a>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
                    <p>If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend</li>
                        <li>serious injury</li>
                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
                    </ul>
