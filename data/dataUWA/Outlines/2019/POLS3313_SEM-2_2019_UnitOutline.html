To this end, the international context and historical evolution of Australian foreign policy, as well as the process of foreign policy making in Canberra, are examined. Students are introduced to the concepts, ideas and discourse associated with academic foreign policy analysis. Australia’s key bilateral relationships, especially China and the United States are investigated. Finally, attention is paid to contemporary issue areas such security/terrorism, asylum seekers and human rights. The unit provides a context-specific, in-depth examination of foreign policy practice. It draws upon and critically engages with key theory used in international relations and foreign policy analysis, enabling students to place Australian foreign policy in comparative and global analytical frameworks. Students undertake specific case-study analyses of contemporary foreign policy problems in order to develop an understanding of the utility of international relations concepts and theories and their applicability to real world problems. This enables students to think like foreign policy analysts and to make informed judgements about the nature and content of the policy-making process.</td>

Australia is usually considered an archetypal ‘middle power’, and it remains one of the safest and most-prosperous states in the world; yet the new millennium is throwing many challenges Canberra’s way, like the problem of taking effective action against climate change, and how to treat those who land on our shores seeking asylum. But China’s rise has also precipitated an enormous and fractious debate about how Australia should balance its economic interests (with China) and its security interests (with the US). This balancing act is becoming ever-more difficult as rivalry between those two great powers heats up.

We first explore how foreign policy is made in Canberra, before a brief overview of Australia’s foreign policy history is provided. We then consider how Labor and Coalition governments have tended to approach international affairs somewhat differently, before we examine a range of key bilateral relationships, with special emphasis on the increasingly fraught US-China relationship, and the implications of this for Australia. The unit finishes with close attention to a number of key foreign policy issues which Canberra must do its best to address: strategic policy, asylum seekers, climate change, gender security and trade diplomacy. 

The Unit Co-ordinator, Dr Alan Bloomfield, will deliver 75% of the lectures, with the remainder delivered by academics with particular expertise in certain topics, plus distinguished visitors like Sue Boyd (a former diplomat) and Stephen Smith (a former Defence Minister).

‘Broadly speaking’, half of the points are allocated for ‘showing up’ and the rest for participation, but this is not a hard-and-fast rule; for example, if you miss a few tutorials but you are an outstanding participant when present you may still get a very high mark. Use these criteria as a guide:
- Fail (0-49%) – Hardly ever attends, and/or when in attendance says nothing, is obviously distracted by social media on e-devices and/or is actively disruptive, etc.
- Pass mark (50%) – Attends about half the tutorials, but is a ‘passive participant’ (i.e. no evidence of preparation and/or meaningful contribution)
- Credit (60-69%) – Attends over half, some evidence of preparation, participates actively in class discussions occasionally (i.e. can engage with 1 of the discussion questions)
- Distinction (70-79%) – Attends most tutorials, clear evidence of preparation, active participation and contribution to class discussions (i.e. means ‘has obviously done, and understood, the readings’ and can ‘engage with 2 of the discussion questions’).
- High distinction (80%+) – Attends almost all tutorials, high degree of critical engagement, makes original and relevant contributions to discussion (i.e. means ‘has obviously done, and fully understood, the readings’ and can ‘engage with all 3 of the discussion questions’).
Discussion Questions: each week 3 discussion questions are posed (see the Readings below). The tutor will ask these – and related ‘follow-up’ questions – to guide discussion. You should think about these questions while you are doing your readings; note this does not mean you must prepare notes (although doing so might be helpful). The tutors may also ask other questions related to the topic.</p></pre>

A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.
- Extensions: the Unit Coordinator (Alan) and the tutors cannot grant extensions; if poor health or other difficult circumstances mean you need an extension, you must apply through the Student Office (Ground Floor, Social Sciences North Building; entry facing main/central carpark; weekdays 8.30am to 4.30pm; phone – 6488 2091)

Penalty for exceeding word limit
Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.

Referencing
You are not required to use one referencing style, but we do recommend either APA/Harvard in-text or Chicago footnotes. Find a style guide here: <a href='https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/c.php?g=361770&p=2443621' target='_blank'>https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/c.php?g=361770&p=2443621</a>

Academic misconduct
Academic Integrity is defined in the University Policy on Academic Conduct as ‘acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research’. UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.
Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled. Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding academic conduct and ethical scholarship at UWA.

Review and Appeal of Academic Decisions Relating to Students
The full regulations governing appeal are available on the Governance website.

Plagiarism
This is the most common form of academic misconduct (other forms include acting aggressively towards fellow students, or offering tutors inducements in exchange for better marks, etc.). The following is a summary of the Faculty’s policy regarding plagiarism, not a replacement of it. 
First Rule: PLAGIARISM – DON’T DO IT!

What is Plagiarism?   
Plagiarism occurs when someone disguises or misrepresents the authorship of written work and claims it as his or her own, when in fact it has been copied from someone else’s written work. There are two general forms;
1) ‘less serious’ plagiarism involves cutting/pasting from another person’s work into your essay and not indicating such (i.e. by surrounding the quote with quote marks); but then the student does cite the source from which the words came (often at the end of the paragraph; so, not directly after the quote, as should occur). This is still technically plagiarism, and so is punishable, but is less indicative of cheating; rather, it suggests ‘laziness’ and/or ‘misunderstanding’.
2) ‘more serious’ plagiarism involves cutting/pasting from another person’s work into your essay without ever citing the source. This suggests deliberate cheating in the sense of an attempt to ‘pass off’ some else’s work as your own.
- Sometimes students will try to avoid being caught by changing some of the words in the quote; be warned, Turn It In will not be fooled, it will still highlight the section which was cut then pasted into your essay despite the fact not all the words are exactly the same.
- When we find this sort of thing it is more indicative of cheating; it suggests a deliberate attempt to ‘beat the software’.
3) ‘conceptual plagiarism’: this occurs not when you have cut/paste another’s words into your essay, but when you have deliberately ‘stolen their ideas’ and ‘passed them off as your own’. It is more difficult to prove this is the case – after all, you might have arrived at the insight on your own – but you are still strongly advised to not plagiarise in this manner either because a marker is likely to recognise that your ‘original idea’ is actually not very original and penalise you, or they may even suspect you have plagiarised and formally report you.
- Remember: the markers will be much more familiar with ‘the literature’ than you are; they are likely to recognise that the idea or theory (etc.) which you have attempted to pass off as your own was ‘actually first recognised by Prof X decades ago’.

Second Rule: IF IN DOUBT, CITE! (insert quote marks and references when using other author’s words and ideas – play it safe)

Turn It In: When you submit an essay online it will be checked for plagiarism by this software, which searches the entire internet – not just html files but pdf, rich text, word docs in student essay repositories at other universities, etc. – and then generates a report which indicates exactly where plagiarism is to be found in an essay, and where it came from.
Students can generate their own similarity reports prior to handing their essays in to check they haven’t plagiarised; doing so is strongly recommended. Note that Turn It In has been set to exclude ‘quoted material’ and ‘bibliography/footnotes: thus a report with something up to about 5% similarity is likely to be OK but, anything over this will be scrutinised by the tutors. Anything over 10% will attract ‘close’ scrutiny, so be prepared to re-draft your paper to reduce the score, and then re-submit it.
Third Rule: DON’T TRY TO BEAT TURN IT IN! (this software is extremely effective – you WILL be caught)

If caught, what is the process?
Tutors will consider the similarity report generated by Turn It In. If the tutor suspects plagiarism the Unit Coordinator is advised, and they check too. If the Unit Coordinator believes plagiarism is indicated, the student is reported to a central unit in the School which handles all subsequent stages (assessment, counselling, discipline). The Unit Coordinator’s involvement is strictly limited.

What are the penalties?  
Penalties vary with the seriousness of the offence and are set out in the Faculty’s policy referred to above.  In relatively less serious cases a range of penalties can be applied, including:
- counselling only; handing in another version of the essay; handing in another essay entirely (i.e. a different question), with a pre-determined penalty (perhaps 20%) applied; the paper is graded ‘as if plagiarised sections were absent’ (making the paper ‘disjointed’), etc. 
In the case of work found to contain serious plagiarism, more serious penalties can apply;
- awarded ‘0’ for the assignment and not allowed to hand in another; awarded the grade ‘N-Fail’ for the unit; suspension from the university; expulsion from the university, etc.

Repeat Offenses: 
If the student has a prior record of academic misconduct, more severe penalties will be applied, perhaps even to cases which would otherwise be considered ‘less serious’ offences. All instances of plagiarism and other forms of academic misconduct are entered on a confidential record held centrally at the University, so that graduated penalties can be applied in accordance with the student’s record. The defence ‘but I have done this without penalty in other units’ is unacceptable (like the driver who, when caught speeding, complains that they haven’t been caught before). 

How to avoid it? 
The best way to avoid plagiarism is to get into the habit of distinguishing your own work from that of other people.  We assume that unreferenced work is your own, so make sure that phrases and sentences that are not your own are in quotation marks and given precise citations, and that ideas and arguments that are not your own are properly cited.  In cases of concepts or facts which are widely used or known citation may not be necessary; for example, ‘the sky is (usually) blue’ or ‘Australia has six states’ do not need citations. To avoid accidental plagiarism, ensure that the notes you use to prepare your essay clearly identify quotations and have full references. 
- but don’t over-use quotes – a rough guide is that no more than 10% of an essay should be quoted material – and something closer to a maximum of 5% is ‘best practice’

Final rule: PLAGIARISM – JUST DON’T DO IT!

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
