CONTENT
This unit is compulsory for all students taking a major in Chemistry. It provides an introduction to the application of chemical skills to problems in the real world through a number of structured enquiry-based learning approaches. These include literature searching to locate background information and data relevant to the problems, a range of experiments conducted by small teams of students, oral/visual presentations of results and extensive interaction via the LMS (Learning Management System) discussion board. Emphasis is also placed on more advanced aspects of core chemical principles and experimental techniques common to physical, analytical, inorganic and organic chemistry.

There are three components to this unit that will be mentored by the academic staff of the School.

SECTION A. Writing a Research Proposal.
Coordinated by Prof. George Koutsantonis

            Students will be expected to write a research proposal on a topic of relevance in chemistry.  The third year cohort will be assigned to a staff member, in groups of ca. 5 students, who will provide guidance in the choice of a topic.

The putative timeline of the proposal should be 1 year. The proposal should be no more than 5 A4 pages in length, single-spaced 12 point Times New Roman font. Illustrations, schematics are encouraged. The proposal should clearly state the Aims and Significance of the research, and the Research Plan, Methods and Techniques, as described below.
 
o	Aims and significance
In this section you should outline the aims of your project, stating clearly what you intend to accomplish over the duration of the grant.
You should critically evaluate the present state of knowledge in the field at the international level, and describe how your own proposal relates to that knowledge. Identify the gaps and contradictions that you will clarify. Cite relevant references where appropriate, and explain why your own approach is different from the work of others.
Explain the significance of the outcomes of the research in your proposal. How will your results advance knowledge of the field at an international level? Emphasise the novelty of the project, or your approach to it. And above all, communicate a sense of commitment and enthusiasm to your assessors.
 
o	Research plan, methods and techniques
In this section you must outline your approach to carrying out the proposed research. This section should be the largest part of your proposal, and is the place to elaborate on the details of the project.
The research plan should give an overall viewpoint of the research to be conducted throughout the project. The methods subsection should explain the strategies you will use to carry out your research. The techniques subsection can discuss the types of experiments you will undertake to verify your research, or the specific technological requirements to carry it out.

Other important tips to follow in this section include the following:
o	There is no need to expound upon well-known techniques; naming them will do.
o	If the project is dependent upon the availability of subjects, materials, or specialist resources, explain how you will obtain access to them.

Assessment
 The completed research proposal will need to submitted for assessment one week before the end of semester, Friday 18th October 2019.

It will comprise one third of the total assessment for the unit.  A marking guide will be provided for staff to mark proposals.
 
Section B. Journal Club
Coordinated by Prof. Swaminatha Iyer and Prof. George Koutsantonis 

The task:
o	Students will choose a primary research article from a selection of good journals provided by the academic staff. Letters/short articles will be best to allow adequate coverage in the short presentation time. 
o	Students will prepare and deliver a computer presentation of ~7 min duration, followed by up to 3 min of questions.
o	The primary job will be to explain the science in the paper, keeping in mind the non-specialist audience.
o	Students will deliver their presentations individually to ensure they are fairly rewarded for their efforts.
o	Students will be expected to ask questions
o	Participation will be recorded and a small percentage of marks will be allocated for asking sensible questions.
o	Staff will also ask questions.
 

Timetabling:
o	~13 × 45 min sessions are required for each group, running twice a week from semester weeks 34-39 and 41 (Note: week 40 is study break) in two groups.
o	Presentation order will be randomly assigned.
o	Student attendance at all of their groups presentations is compulsory unless they have a medical certificate.
o	Earlier lecture slots will be used for:
o	a tutorial on searching the chemical literature
o	a ‘how to give a seminar’ seminar.
o	Academic staff will be rostered on to attend sessions. This roster will take into account the nature of the presentations so that the majority of the academic audience has the right expertise.
 Assessment:
o	A marking guide will be provided to staff and students
o	Attendance 10% of the Mark
o	Marks will be awarded by all present, including students
o	Weighting of marks will be 50% academic staff: 50% students
It will comprise one third of the total assessment for the unit.

Section C. Laboratory and Research Placement 

Coordinated by 
Swaminatha Iyer (Research Placements) ; 
Matthew Piggott, George Koutsantonis and Duncan Wild (Laboratory)

 Laboratory: will be conducted in the Synthetic and Physical labs using a roster that will be similar to that used in first semester for Chem3001.

It will comprise one third of the total assessment for the unit.

Research Placement: a limited number of research projects will be offered to students who are enrolled in Chemistry Major and who are enrolled in CHEM3002. Students who have achieved an average grade of 70% or more in their second year Chemistry unit(s) will be eligible to apply for research placements. These projects will be supervised in the research laboratories of staff members of the School of Molecular Sciences and will take the place of during the same time as the normal teaching laboratory classes. Attendance for research placement is compulsory as it would be in the case of normal teaching laboratory.

Student who are ineligible to undertake a research placement (see requirements above) or who are eligible but do not intended to take part in the research placement or who apply, but are not allocated a project will undertake the normal teaching lab components of CHEM3002.

Some students may not be allocated a supervisor in the event that there are more eligible students who apply than projects, in which case those students will join the normal teaching laboratory classes associated with CHEM3002.  

Students are required to produce their laboratory books along the similar lines as a laboratory report at the end of their research placement.  The laboratory book should detail carefully the experiments undertaken, along with the results of their experiments.  Students will be assessed on research placement laboratory books submitted to their research placement supervisor. Assessment of the research placement will be as similar as possible to the assessment of the normal teaching laboratory components of CHEM3002. The assessments of the research placement report will contribute one third of the total marks for CHEM3002, as is the case for the normal teaching laboratory components of these units.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
