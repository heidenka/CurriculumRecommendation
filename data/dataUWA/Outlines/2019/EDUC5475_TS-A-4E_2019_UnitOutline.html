Assignment 1: Video Analysis              	
40%                          	
~1800 words

For science majors:

Assignment 1 consists of two parts: Part A is a presentation of a five minute segment of your video and a 5 minute discussion and Part B is a written video analysis.

Part A (10%) a) Show and discuss a segment of the videotape of your lesson to your classmates. This segment will be no longer than 5 minutes and will mostly be of you teaching (i.e. the majority of the video segment should not be of the students working on a worksheet); b) Prepare a 5 minute discussion about one aspect of your teaching that is evident in the video segment and about which you learnt something during your practicum. For example, the aspect of teaching could be any one of the following: conducting demonstrations, classroom safety, using models to explain science concepts, questioning in the classroom, managing laboratory equipment, modelling problem solving, monitoring students’ work in class, setting homework, concluding a lesson, keeping students motivated, teacher’s explanations, etc; c) NOT behaviour management as this is covered in Teaching Contexts; d) Aim to generate some discussion in the class about this aspect of your teaching and draw on the other pre-service teachers’ experiences. You should aim for approximately 5 minutes video and 5 minutes talk/discussion (10 minutes in total).

Part B (30%)
For Part B of this assignment, you are required to provide a written analysis of the videotape of your lesson made during the first school experience.  The following are suggested headings for your assignment: a) Introduction: Briefly introduce and summarise your assignment (approx 100 words); b) Context: In this section include a brief description of the general school educational environment, the specific class in the video, achievement level, previous lessons and any relevant information (approx 200 words); c) Theory: In this section provide an overview of the literature you will use to make judgements about your teaching. You should explain how and why this aspect is important for teaching and learning science. Include references to your textbook, lecture notes, and other literature that helped you to develop your analysis (approx 500 words); d) Analysis of Teaching: This section should include a discussion (i.e. strengths and weaknesses) of the lesson on the video tape based on the theory. It may be useful to write down quotes from you as the teacher in the video and/or the students that demonstrate each aspect, or write down the time and a short description of certain activities/events that occurred that are relevant to each aspect. This analysis should form the main part of your assignment and should include a discussion of the theory in terms of whether there is evidence that you have achieved this aspect in your teaching and/or whether there is room for improvement in some way. You may use tables, figures, diagrams and dot points. (approx 800 words); e) Conclusions and Implications: A brief summary and overview of your assignment and the implications of your learning for your future teaching (approx 200 words); f) References: Include a list of all references using the APA style. (not included in word count); g) Format: Please state word count on cover page, paginate, use headings and subheadings

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the topic from the teacher and the student perspectives and with different types of students/schools. Reflect on how you would use this topic to improve student learning. (approx. 1000 words); d) Conclusions and Implications: A brief summary and overview of your assignment and the implications of your learning for your future teaching (approx 200 words); e) References: Include a list of all references using the APA style. (not included in word count); f) Format: Please state word count on cover page, paginate, use headings and subheadings

Assignment 2: Probing Students’ Understanding 
60%                       	 
~3000 words

Regardless of teaching approach, finding out students’ prior knowledge is crucial in science teaching. Research suggests that students have many alternative conceptions about science concepts that teachers need to take into consideration when planning. This assignment requires you to collect detailed information from secondary school students to find out what they already know about a science concept of your choice that will be taught in Year 11 or Year 12 Biology, Human Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Earth and Environmental Science, Psychology or Integrated Science. If you are not on professional practice or are unable to access data from secondary students you may survey your colleagues, friends or family.

Suitable topics can be found in the SCSA syllabus documents and textbooks. Topics might include genes and DNA; atomic structure; chemical bonding; Newton’s first law of motion; gravity; or the difference between heat and temperature. You must collect data to present in your assignment. The data you collect will depend on the method that you choose to probe the students’ understanding of the topic.
You can also create your own method of probing the students’ understanding using diagrams and photographs to get the students thinking about the concept. You can also ask them to draw pictures, create a concept map or mind map or to write a paragraph about the topic. The purpose is to find out what the students know. You need to be careful about how you do this. If you ask students “what do you know about equilibrium? It is likely they will respond, “I don’t know anything.” Please note that multiple choice questions alone usually are not suitable for probing students’ understanding, unless the students’ are then asked about why they gave particular answers. You may need to trial your method of probing understanding with one or two students and then refine it before you collect the final data for this assignment.

You can collect your data while you are on your teaching practicum. An example of a suitable approach might be to get the whole class to complete a short test, problem, quiz, POE (predict-observe-explain), concept map, concept cartoon, or diagram about the concept as the starting point. Then, based on the responses to this activity, you could select five students to call aside in a later lesson to interview one-by-one for five minutes so that you can ask them more probing questions about what they think about the concept and why they gave those answers. It is recommended that you collect the data for the assignment in the first two weeks of practicum when you are doing more observation and less teaching.

The following subheadings are suggested headings for your assignment: a) Introduction: Briefly introduce and summarise your assignment (approx. 150 words); b) Overview of the science concept (approx 200 words). In this section provide a scientific explanation of the concept that will be the focus of your assignment. Refer to science textbooks or other resources from where you gathered this information and include these in the references section of the assignment; c) Links with the upper secondary subjects (approx 150 words). This section will consist of a description of where this topic is found in the Year 11 and 12 syllabus documents. List the relevant syllabus in the references section of your assignment; d) Literature review (approx 500 words) - In this section provide a literature review of research that has been conducted about students’ prior knowledge about the concept. A variety of journals, books and websites are available online and through the library that focus on research in science education. You must include all references in the reference section of your assignment; e) Methods of data collection and analysis (approx 500 words) - In this section include a clear and succinct description of the methods and procedure you used to probe the students’ understanding of the concept. Full copies of any interview protocols, quiz questions or problems used to probe the students’ understanding are placed in an appendix. Describe the way you analysed the data, that is, how you changed/manipulated that data so that it could be presented in the findings section (below) in a succinct and informative manner; f) Findings: Students’ prior knowledge about the concept (approx 1000 words) - In this section you will describe your findings about the students’ understandings of the concept. Data can be best presented in graphs, short summaries and succinct examples of student work or interview excerpts to give an overview of what you found about the students’ understandings.  The findings should be linked with the literature review by explaining how your findings are similar to, or different from, those in the literature; g) Implications for teaching and learning (approx 500 words) - In this section discuss the implications of your findings about the students’ understanding of the concept for teaching and learning. That is, based on what you found out about the students’ understandings, how would you go about teaching these ideas to the students? What would it be necessary to do to convince students that some of their ideas are not correct? How would you introduce and consolidate the concepts so that conceptual change is likely to take place?
 
Assessment 3: Moderation Assessment (Pass/Fail):

Moderation is an important aspect of assessment to ensure fairness and reliability. You will be required to mark and moderate through discussion a provided science assessment from a secondary science subject. A marking key will be provided. More details will be provided in class. The assessment will be a pass (satisfactory) or fail (inadequate or not done).

RESUBMISSION RULE:  

Failure to pass an assessment item within a unit (MTeach) 

15. Students must pass all components of a Master of Teaching unit to pass the unit overall. Students who fail an assessment item in a unit may resubmit it if— 
(a) this is their first request for a resubmission in the unit; 
(b) they contact the unit coordinator by email within 5 University working days of the release of the result and formally request a resubmission. 
(c) A resubmitted assignment that is deemed to be a ‘fail’ by the unit coordinator, will receive the original failing mark for the component. 
(d) Where resubmission is approved, the reassessed mark is capped at the assessment pass mark, unless an application for mitigation is approved in accordance with the University Policy on Assessment: Special Consideration (UP11/23). 
(e) A resubmission is normally due one week after being approved by the unit coordinator. 
(f) Assignments that are failed on the grounds of lateness or academic misconduct will not normally be considered for resubmission.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
                    <p>If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend</li>
