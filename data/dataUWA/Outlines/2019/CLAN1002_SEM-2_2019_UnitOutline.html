                                    <td>In the broad sweep of world history, a handful of periods and cultures are of outstanding importance. Among these, the civilisations of the ancient Greeks and Romans stand out as times of remarkable achievements and significant technological advances. Many of the foundations of the modern world were laid in this period by such seminal figures as Homer, Socrates, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar and Jesus Christ. Over two millennia the Greeks spread abroad and settled in numerous places around the Mediterranean, the foundations of modern democracy were laid, and the Roman Empire subsequently came to rule over much of the civilised world, in what has been called 'the boundless grandeur of the Roman peace'. Students are given an outline of the history of this period and are encouraged to achieve an understanding of the processes by which they can study it today from the written and archaeological evidence. Topics include urbanisation, political and social development, warfare and religion, and the enduring legacy of the period. 

This unit is an excellent basis for further study in ancient history and provides a good background for studies in archaeology, European studies, history and philosophy. It aims to impart knowledge about the most significant periods in world history, to interpret and explain those features of it which are of enduring significance for our lives—'history', 'democracy', 'political structures', 'globalisation'. It offers a carefully structured program of lectures, identifying and tracing the development of such major social and political aspects of the ancient Greek and Roman civilisations, while a complementary series of tutorials and take-home assignments examine some of these aspects in depth. The unit emphasises the collection, analysis and criticism of the ancient source material and a written in-class assignment and tutorial discussion of this assignment deals specifically with this crucial aspect of ancient historical study. Although the Classical period is often presented as the bedrock of Western Civilisation, it is seldom taught in schools. The unit simultaneously surveys the broad period and identifies and explains its seminal contributions to our way of life, institutions and modes of thought.</td>

                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>In the broad sweep of world history, a handful of periods and cultures are of outstanding importance. Among these, the civilisations of the ancient Greeks and Romans stand out as times of remarkable achievements and significant technological advances. Many of the foundations of the modern world were laid in this period by such seminal figures as Homer, Socrates, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar and Jesus Christ. Over two millennia the Greeks spread abroad and settled in numerous places around the Mediterranean, the foundations of modern democracy were laid, and the Roman Empire subsequently came to rule over much of the civilised world, in what has been called 'the boundless grandeur of the Roman peace'. Students are given an outline of the history of this period and are encouraged to achieve an understanding of the processes by which they can study it today from the written and archaeological evidence. Topics include urbanisation, political and social development, warfare and religion, and the enduring legacy of the period. 

This unit is an excellent basis for further study in ancient history and provides a good background for studies in archaeology, European studies, history and philosophy. It aims to impart knowledge about the most significant periods in world history, to interpret and explain those features of it which are of enduring significance for our lives—'history', 'democracy', 'political structures', 'globalisation'. It offers a carefully structured program of lectures, identifying and tracing the development of such major social and political aspects of the ancient Greek and Roman civilisations, while a complementary series of tutorials and take-home assignments examine some of these aspects in depth. The unit emphasises the collection, analysis and criticism of the ancient source material and a written in-class assignment and tutorial discussion of this assignment deals specifically with this crucial aspect of ancient historical study. Although the Classical period is often presented as the bedrock of Western Civilisation, it is seldom taught in schools. The unit simultaneously surveys the broad period and identifies and explains its seminal contributions to our way of life, institutions and modes of thought.</p></pre>

With the exception of the first tutorial session (week 2), tutorial performance is assessed, with up to 3 marks allocated for performance at each tutorial session.

In-class tutorial performance is assessed upon:
the contribution to class discussion;
the engagement with the preliminary reading for the tutorial;
the understanding of the ancient evidence demonstrated in the tutorial discussion.</p></pre>

There are a number of referencing styles explained in detail on the UWA library website; if you are unfamiliar with any referencing styles and need somewhere to start, the Chicago style (<a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/Chicago_citation' target='_blank'>http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/Chicago_citation</a>) is perfectly acceptable. Please be aware that slightly different conventions apply when citing ancient authors.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
