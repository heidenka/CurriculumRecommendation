Students work in teams, typically with four to six members, and are supervised by an academic and/or industry mentor. Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project are to lead students through a systematic engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare them for professional practice as engineers.

Students work in teams, typically with four to six members, and are supervised by an academic and/or industry mentor. Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project are to lead students through a systematic engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare them for professional practice as engineers. The focus of this unit is the delivery of outcomes to a professional standard.</p></pre>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>This is the second part of a capstone course and students learn to self-evaluate their work through comprehensive milestone assessment rubrics and face-to-face feedback in practical sessions.  Students learn how to build various forms of unwritten knowledge, including tacit knowledge, implicit knowledge, embodied knowledge and procedural knowledge.  All these are essential for design, but not often mentioned in other courses. This unit enables most students to build their design skills by working on an authentic industry project in collaboration with a local company.</p></pre>

<a href='http://www.cas.uwa.edu.au/' target='_blank'>http://www.cas.uwa.edu.au/</a>

Students are able to (1) apply engineering synthesis and design processes relevant to mechanical engineering; (2) seek out the
requirements and associated resources to assess the scope, dimensions, scale of effort and indicative costs of a complex engineering
project; (3) apply technical knowledge, appropriate tools and problem-solving skills to achieve a desired outcome to satisfy user
requirements; (4) apply project management tools and processes to the planning and execution of a design project; (5) conduct oneself
in a professional manner; (6) critically analyse design inputs, processes and outputs; (7) locate and evaluate relevant standards and
technical literature; (8) use discourse conventions relevant to the discipline; (9) communicate clearly, effectively and appropriately using
written, oral and visual means; and (10) contribute to and/or manage a complex engineering project activity, as a member and/or leader
of an engineering team.
Students understand the different kinds of knowledge required to support design activity: explicit, propositional knowledge, implicit knowledge,
contextual, procedural, tacit, etc. Students will be able to give examples of each different kind of knowledge and describe their learning
in each knowledge category.</p></pre>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>

                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
