                    <h3>Unit Structure</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>This unit consists of lectures (1 one-hour session per week, on Wednesdays) and seminars (2 one-hour sessions per week, on Wednesdays and Thursdays, respectively).
o	The content focus of this unit is on introducing students to three essential themes regarding the Chinese state in the contemporary era. Your skills in applying the Chinese language will get enhanced along the way. Through the readings of relevant academic and media publications, and through the discussions and debates both in and beyond the classroom, you will develop both your Chinese language skills and critical thinking skills along with your understanding on contemporary China.
o	The reading materials for each week will be made available on Blackboard at least 7 days prior to the lecture on Monday, and you are expected to read all required readings, and as much as the recommended readings, before attending the lecture and seminars.
o	The lecture sessions will give you an overview on the topic for the week, including the key concepts/definitions, a brief review over the relevant historical processes, and an outline of the major issues and debates on the week's topic in and beyond the field of Chinese Studies. Feel free to interrupt me with questions related to the topic at any time during the lecture.
o	In the seminar sessions, you are expected to play even more active roles. Indeed, seminars are collective learning activities, and a student-centred approach will be implemented throughout all seminar sessions in this unit. In particular, the seminar sessions on Thursday will primarily be student-led presentations and discussions. All participants are highly encouraged to challenge each other's arguments (including those of my own) through logically-coherent counter-arguments and in a polite and civilized manner.</p></pre>

This includes:

(1) Active Engagement (10%)
You must FULLY engage with at least 10 out of the 12 weeks of the teaching period.
Failing to reach this minimum requirement for attendance will incur a penalty of 1 point (in your final unit score) per each week that was not fully engaged unless there is a formal doctor’s note which indicates that you need to be absent for three teaching weeks or an even longer period. For example, if by the end of the semester you only fully attended the lecture and seminar in 8 weeks, then you will only gain 8 out of the 10 possible points for your attendance. (Please be noted that a doctor’s note indicating that you will be absent in any one or two teaching weeks will not exempt you from the requirement of FULLY engaging with at least 10 weeks of the teaching and learning activities.)
Please be aware that simply attending a class is NOT necessarily be classified as FULLY engaging with the teaching and learning activities. To fully engage with the teaching and learning activities of this unit, you will need to read all materials, attend both the lecture and the seminars, and actively engage with your tutor and fellow students during the class.

(2) Explicit Contribution (10%)
You are expected to make a substantial amount of contributions to the discussions on and after class.
You earn 1 point (of the final unit score) by conducting the following activities each time: a) offering substantial answers to the questions raised in lectures, b) providing insightful comments during the discussions in seminars, c) posting comments. The maximal points you can earn from this component is 10.</p></pre>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>

UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
