                                    <td>This unit covers a broad range of non-contractual civil actions available to those who have been subjected to the wrongdoing of another. It examines the elements and governing principles of selected tort actions. It also introduces students to the analytical framework of current Australian tort law and addresses the context in which torts law operates. Students are encouraged to engage with the policies and critical theories that underpin the development of the law and have the opportunities to engage in critical analysis. The unit considers the kinds of interests protected by torts law and includes an examination of the torts of trespass and nuisance. Reflecting its dominance in modern Australian torts litigation, a more detailed treatment is given to actions in negligence. The principal defences, and other limitations to a defendant's potential liability, is also considered. Close attention is paid to the <em>Civil Liability Act 2002</em> (WA), particularly in the context of claims for negligently inflicted personal injury. Students develop an understanding of the interaction between case law and legislation, as well as their ability to interpret and apply statutory provisions. Students are also able to analyse novel problems, write opinions, advise clients and present arguments. The unit requires an ongoing development in reading and analysing case law and in conducting legal research.</td>

                    <p>LAWS4106 - LAWS4106_SEM-2-2019_2019 - SEM-2-2019 - 2019 - Face to face / Blended learning</p>
                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>This unit covers a broad range of non-contractual civil actions available to those who have been subjected to the wrongdoing of another. It examines the elements and governing principles of selected tort actions. It also introduces students to the analytical framework of current Australian tort law and addresses the context in which torts law operates. Students are encouraged to engage with the policies and critical theories that underpin the development of the law and have the opportunities to engage in critical analysis. The unit considers the kinds of interests protected by torts law and includes an examination of the torts of trespass and nuisance. Reflecting its dominance in modern Australian torts litigation, a more detailed treatment is given to actions in negligence. The principal defences, and other limitations to a defendant's potential liability, are also considered. Close attention is paid to the <em>Civil Liability Act 2002</em> (WA), particularly in the context of claims for negligently inflicted personal injury. Students develop an understanding of the interaction between case law and legislation, as well as their ability to interpret and apply statutory provisions. Students are also able to analyse novel problems, write opinions, advise clients and present arguments. The unit requires an ongoing development in reading and analysing case law and in conducting legal research.</p></pre>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre>
                    <h3>Teaching and Learning Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>Torts will be run as a blended or 'flipped' model in 2019. Rather than focus on content delivery in the classroom, the content will be delivered online so the student can watch and absorb the information at a time and speed of their own choosing before having an opportunity to discuss and apply content in the small group seminars. The online content will include recorded lectures, podcasts and YouTube videos as well as online quizzes to test your understanding of the material. For more information on 'flipped learning', see this short video, created by the Educational Enhancement Unit at UWA: <a href='https://youtu.be/NiUHWz97TqE' target='_blank'>https://youtu.be/NiUHWz97TqE</a>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>The four hours of instruction time per week will be made up of TWO hours of online lecture and other material, which will be accessible via LMS, and one TWO hour small group seminar. There are no tutorials. This online material will be available a week in advance of the seminars and must be listened to or watched beforehand, as the seminars will presume knowledge of the online content.  Please note that seminars are NOT recorded. 

Seminars commence in Week 1 of semester. You should already be allocated to a seminar through the CAS system. You can change your own class allocations up to Week 1 of semester (subject to availability) on CAS (cas.uwa.edu.au). After that time, please address queries to the Unit Co-ordinator.  It is important that seminar sizes remain consistent and so you should stay in your allocated class for the duration of semester. In cases of sickness or other emergencies, and you can't attend your tutorial for that week, you may attend a make up tutorial for THAT WEEK ONLY and as long as you have contacted Marco or Kate and there is space in the venue.  An alternative space may be suggested if constraints exist. Seminar times are as follows: 

Wednesday: 8 - 10am ARTS 1.61
Wednesday: 4 - 6pm ARTS 1.60
Thursday: 8 - 10am MATHS G.17
Thursday: 4 - 6pm ARTS G. 62

Kate Offer will teach Week 1 and Weeks 8 through to 12. Marco Rizzi will teach Weeks 2 through to 7. </p></pre>

In-class participation:  The requirements for this assessment component are:regular attendance; evidence of prior preparation; the ability to identify legal issues and apply legal principles and being willing to participate in discussions. This includes responding to questions, making comments and generally contributing in a way that develops the discussion (but does not include dominating the discussion.) On-line participation: Every two weeks (starting in Week 3) you will be required to answer 15 quiz questions on LMS, which relate to the course content. You are graded on participation in these quizzes and not solely on whether your answers are correct or incorrect. These quizzes are designed to allow you to check your own understanding of the material. </p></pre>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
