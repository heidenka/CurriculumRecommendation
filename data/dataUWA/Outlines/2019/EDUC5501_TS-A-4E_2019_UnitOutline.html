ADDITIONAL DETAILED ASSESSMENT INFORMATION:

Assignment 1: Lesson planning

Students provide a referenced rationale justifying the use of children’s literature to enrich the teaching of the WA Humanities and Social Sciences curriculum, and a justification for their particular choice of children’s literature to teach an aspect of the WA History curriculum. Students also provide two lesson plans to address the History curriculum where the children’s literature is used to either introduce the content, promote inquiry or consolidate understanding. Challenging learning goals for each lesson must be included as well as an inquiry pedagogy.  

Children’s literature can be used to spark curiosity and challenge children’s thinking in a meaningful way when teaching the Humanities and Social Sciences curriculum.  This assignment will give you the opportunity to select a piece of children’s literature that will add value to your teaching and children’s learning.  The children’s literature can be used in different ways; to introduce content from the History curriculum, to consolidate understanding of previous content covered or to extend and challenge thinking.  There are four parts to this assignment: (1) selecting a suitable piece of children’s literature to address a specific part of the History curriculum, (2) developing two lesson plans (which are underpinned by an inquiry pedagogy) which include the children’s literature, (3) providing a referenced rationale justifying the use of children’s literature in teaching the Humanities and Social Sciences curriculum and a justification to explain why the particular piece of children’s literature was chosen, and (4) providing a brief synopsis of the children’s literature. 
• Choose a specific year level from the History curriculum
• Find a suitable piece of children’s literature to address a specific part of the History curriculum and address a relevant element from the Literacy general capability learning continuum.  
• Consider how the children’s literature will be used in the two lesson plans: (a) to introduce content and spark curiosity in order to promote discussion and inquiry questions, (b) to consolidate and reinforce content previously covered, or (c) to extend children’s ideas of content previously covered.  
• Find relevant research (peer-reviewed where possible) to support the use of children’s literature in the teaching of the Humanities and Social Sciences curriculum.  Consider that you may need to search using slightly different terms to capture relevant research (for example, you may need to search using terms such as Social Studies).  
• Rationale (approximately 800 words).  Use the research to write a justification which outlines the importance and value of using children’s literature to teach the Humanities and Social Sciences curriculum.  You are required to include a minimum of three peer-reviewed references in your rationale. 
• Justify and explain your choice of children’s literature.  Include all of the publishing details of your chosen children’s literature including the title, author, year of publication and publisher.  
• Synopsis (approximately 200 words).  Provide a brief synopsis of the children’s literature in where you provide enough detail for someone who is not familiar with the literature to have an overview of what it includes.  

Assignment 2: Planning document 

Students provide plans for FIVE LESSONS where purposeful and relevant integration is planned between a subject within the Humanities and Social Sciences curriculum (e.g. History, Geography, Civics and Citizenship, and Economics and Business) and another curriculum area. The lessons must follow an inquiry based pedagogy, include clear and challenging learning goals, suitable focus questions and appropriate resources. A summative assessment task and rubric is also required which assesses the relevant curriculum content descriptions.  Students also provide a referenced rationale which outlines the focus for the sequence of lessons and justification and explanation for why the curriculum areas have been integrated.  

The purpose of this assignment is to provide you with the opportunity to plan a sequence of lessons where you demonstrate purposeful and valuable integration of curriculum areas (e.g. History and English, Geography and Science, Geography and Mathematics) as well as addressing relevant general capabilities and cross-curriculum priorities.  There are three parts to this assignment: (1) a referenced rationale, (2), a sequence of five lessons underpinned by an inquiry pedagogy, including resources and (3) a summative assessment task and rubric to address the relevant curriculum identified.  

• Select a specific year level and subject from the WA Humanities and Social Sciences curriculum and then choose a specific focus for your lesson sequence.  Remember to include content descriptions which address content (Knowledge and Understanding) and skills (Humanities and Social Sciences Skills).
• Identify relevant and purposeful links in other curriculum areas where integration would add value to the teaching and the children’s learning.  
• Identify relevant links to the general capabilities and cross-curriculum priorities.
• Plan challenging learning goals, key inquiry questions and focus questions which will stimulate the children’s curiosity and promote engagement.  
• Provide suitable resources (quality, engaging, age appropriate, aligned with the curriculum) which you will use in the lesson sequence.   You are required to include all of the resources for this lesson sequence, including identifying where the digital resource (assessment 3) will be used.  You need to include embedded URL links, images, handouts, sources etc. with appropriate source acknowledgement. If you are adapting or modifying any resources you must acknowledge the original source appropriately.  
• Plan your lesson sequence where an inquiry pedagogy is explicit and a variety of learning experiences are included.  Consider the sequence of the activities to ensure that appropriate scaffolding is in place.    
• Plan a summative assessment task which assesses students’ knowledge and understanding of the curriculum content identified.  You are required to provide the details of the assessment task including any instructions, handouts or information in the appendices.  
• Construct a marking rubric which can be used by the teacher to provide feedback to the students about their performance on the assessment.  Include the marking rubric in the appendices. 
• Rationale (approximately 300 words).  Identify relevant research which provides support and justification for purposeful curriculum integration and explain why you have chosen to integrate the way that you have for this lesson sequence.   A minimum of three peer-reviewed references must be included in the rationale.  

Assignment 3: Multimodal resource 

Students create a multimodal resource to enrich their teaching and the children’s learning of specific content within a subject of the Humanities and Social Sciences curriculum.  To accompany the multimodal resource, students provide a referenced rationale which outlines how the multimodal resource will be used in a sequence of lessons where a subject from the Humanities and Social Sciences curriculum (e.g. History, Geography, Civics and Citizenship, and Economics and Business) is integrated with another curriculum area.  

The purpose of this assignment is to provide you with the opportunity to develop a multimodal resource which will add value to your teaching of an aspect of the WA Humanities and Social Sciences curriculum.  There are two parts to this assignment: (1) developing a  multimodal resource and (2) providing a referenced rationale. 

• While you are planning your second assignment, you need to think about a multimodal resource that you can develop which will add value to your teaching and children’s learning in addressing a particular part of the WA Humanities and Social Sciences curriculum and integration with another curriculum area.  
• Develop the multimodal resource taking into consideration the following: the age of the children, the topic or skill, how it will be used, the language ability of the children, their interests, accessibility and other available resources. What does your multimodal resource provide that is different? You can use an available source and modify it to change the focus or age of the intended audience as long as you cite and acknowledge all sources that you have used and where modifications have been made. The multimodal resource should be engaging and relevant to the specific content or skill focus.  It can include sound, images, videos, interactive elements and animation.  Make sure that you edit your multimodal resource carefully to ensure that it is suitable for the year level and content. 
• Consider when and how the multimodal resource will be used to gain maximum value either through introducing a topic or skill, promoting discussion and inquiry questions, consolidating understanding or extending children’s thinking.   
• Rationale (approximately 300 words).  Provide a referenced rationale which outlines how multimodal resource can enhance students’ learning and engagement as well as how the multimodal resource will be used to maximise its value in the learning sequence.  A minimum of three peer-reviewed references must be included in the rationale.  

RESUBMISSION RULE:  

Failure to pass an assessment item within a unit (MTeach) 
Students must pass all components of a Master of Teaching unit to pass the unit overall. Students who fail an assessment item in a unit may resubmit it if:
a.	This is their first request for a resubmission in the unit. 
b.	They contact the unit coordinator by email within 5 University working days of the release of the result and formally request a resubmission. 
c.	A resubmitted assignment that is deemed to be a ‘fail’ by the unit coordinator, will receive the original failing mark for the component.
d.	Where resubmission is approved, the reassessed mark is capped at the assessment pass mark, unless an application for mitigation is approved in accordance with the University Policy on Assessment: Special Consideration (UP11/23). 
e.	A resubmission is normally due one week after being approved by the unit coordinator. 
f.	Assignments that are failed on the grounds of lateness or academic misconduct will not normally be considered for resubmission.
