The unit examines the different social, cultural, organisational, regulatory and ethical aspects of a changing and 'disrupted' industry landscape. Students undertake a case study or project relevant to their own field of interest and develop critical and practical skills in research design, project management, and other common activities used in the contemporary professional working environment.</p></pre>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>This unit invites you to bring theory and practice together in the context of thinking about the current ‘disrupted’ state of media enterprise and creative labour. ‘Media enterprise’ refers here to different ways of thinking about media work and the media and communication industries. But it also encompasses thinking about your own efforts and transition beyond university. So the unit will also include a component of career planning and strategizing. This double meaning of the term ‘media enterprise’ means that you should ideally put yourself into the subject matter and use the assessments to follow your own areas of interest. Because everyone’s areas of interest will be different this will involve a degree of independent learning and research. 

This unit is delivered in a lecture/tutorial format. Attendance at the lectures will help focus tutorial discussion and students are requested to make special efforts to attend guest lectures, as those professionals give up time to prepare and deliver their presentation. 

The responsibilities of the unit coordinator are to provide contemporary relevant resources to students and to ensure the assessments enhance student learning and unit outcomes. 

The responsibilities of the tutor are to ensure a safe, inclusive, fair and productive learning environment. Their role is to facilitate discussion not lecture students. Their role is also to assess work according to university policy. 

Tutorials rely on productive engagement between participants, so a responsibility of students is to strive towards productive and respective participation, based on a thorough understanding of the learning materials presented. If you have any concerns about the conduct of tutorials please discuss this with your tutor in the first instance or the Unit coordinator. 

This unit operates through close engagement with and reading of texts. Students have a responsibility to remain engaged with the conceptual frameworks underlying the unit. Students must come to class fully prepared, ready to discuss the readings. Careful note-taking is advised.

These are significant case studies in disruption. Inquiries only get established when serious matters are in play. This lecture forms a tour of some of those inquiries and their findings, which give us a sense of how media enterprise is being disrupted and the issues arising. Understanding the pressures on media enterprises today allows you to begin to read and navigate the landscape. Thinking about inquiries and reports also takes us into the policy sphere, a form and approach to analysis that will be useful to your own professional development. 

TUTORIALS: In our first tutorial we shall focus on Housekeeping, go through the unit assessments, but also focus in on disruption in the media and communication industries in Australia.</p></pre></td></tr><tr><td>3 </td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>12/08/2019</p></pre></td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>‘Creative Labour’ and ‘Media Work’</p></pre></td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>Readings: Gill, R 2011, ‘“Life is a pitch”: managing the self in new media work’, in Managing media work, ed M Deuze, Sage, Los Angeles, pp. 249–262.

In this lecture we will explore key concepts of ‘Creative Labour’ and ‘Media Work’.  Following the publication of Mark Deuze’s book Media work in 2007, there has been a wave of analysis of the relationship between ‘life, work and media’ at a time when industries are converging and diverging. This lecture introduces you to ‘media work’ as an important perspective on media occupations and creative industries in a digital age. In the second hour we will be joined by staff from the Careers Centre.

TUTORIALS: In this week’s tutorials we’ll look critically at the contemporary dimensions of media work, going through Rosalind Gill’s 10 key features of media lives. We will also consider Florida’s argument, and ask is Perth an attractive destination for the Creative Class.

This lecture introduces a theory of social learning focused on communities of practice. Through the lens of this theory we will re-think industries and networks as communities that shape and define practice and discourse about practice. Media and communication industries are indeed a kind of community of practice, so it is in your interest to understand this framework and what it offers. This week sees the first of our quizzes, so make sure you complete these to attain the marks. 

TUTORIALS: In this week’s tutorials we will discuss the written assessment. We shall also focus on the roles of communities of practice in the media and communication industries and how they might sustain or constrain certain kinds of practice and opportunities. Being aware of and understanding the communities of practice relevant to you will reveal new pathways for you.</p></pre></td></tr><tr><td>5 </td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>26/08/2019</p></pre></td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>Approaches to Industry: ‘Production of Culture’ </p></pre></td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>Readings: Peterson, RA & Anand, N 2004, ‘The production of culture perspective’, Annual Review of Sociology, vol. 30, pp. 311–321, 326–328 [Excerpt].

There are many different theories and theorists working in the area of production of culture, but in this week we will focus primarily on the work of Peterson and Anand, which was influential on Deuze’s work. We shall also draw on Havens and Lotz’s 'industrialisation’ of culture model. They offer similar but slightly different takes on the study of industries. The capacity to see industry in terms of different ‘facets’, and the interaction between facets, is an important analytical skill. Having a detailed understanding of the production of culture in a particular area allows you to situate your interests more precisely. You may be inclined more towards law or regulation, or technology, and each of these bring different issues into play. 

TUTORIALS: In this week’s tutorials we will bed down our understanding of the production of culture and also compare and contrast the two models of thinking about communities of practice and industry presented so far. </p></pre></td></tr><tr><td>6 </td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>02/09/2019</p></pre></td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>Approaches to Industry: ‘The Circuit of Culture’</p></pre></td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>Reading: Champ, JG 2008, ‘Horizontal power, vertical weakness: Enhancing the “circuit of culture”, Popular Communication, vol. 6, no. 2, pp. 85–89 [Excerpt].</p></pre></td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>Quiz no. 3 </p></pre></td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>Continuing with the theme of analysing industries, but this time focusing in on ‘technology’, this lecture focuses on a famous approach called the ‘circuit of culture’. The innovative aspect of this approach is the emphasis it places on ‘representations’ which is neglected in the other approaches we have looked at. Today, ‘representations’ are very carefully managed so understanding this model forms a very useful addition to your analytical, research skills set. 

TUTORIALS: In this week’s tutorials we bed down our understanding of the circuit of culture, in the context of the three approaches to industry presented so far, as a lead up to the submission of the written piece. </p></pre></td></tr><tr><td>7 </td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>09/09/2019</p></pre></td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>Working up a Major project and Proposal.</p></pre></td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>Reading: NA</p></pre></td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>Assessment 02 due Monday 9th September</p></pre></td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>With the quizzes complete and written assignment now submitted it is timely to think about the major project and its requirements. The first part of this Major project is the proposal. Writing in template is a key skill that graduates need to learn, especially if you plan to apply for grants and funding, and often when you respond to a brief for clients. Proposals are formative documents that allow for quick feedback from your peers and co-workers (and in our case your tutors).The proposal sets the foundations for your major project, which will allow you to demonstrate those core research, analytical and problem-serving skills valued in the communication and media industries.

TUTORIALS: This tutorial presents an opportunity to pitch and workshop your major project for this unit in class. We will start with the proposal. You should have a good understanding of this template. You should have a topic and a sense of which option you will choose. Also whether you will do a report or essay. Advanced students will have a question and will have begun to identify scholarly sources for their ‘literature review’. If you have worked these out bring your question to class in a simple statement form. </p></pre></td></tr><tr><td>8 </td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>16/09/2019</p></pre></td><td><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>No lecture this week.

As per the discipline style guide: • Use Harvard referencing style. <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/friendly.php?s=harvard' target='_blank'>http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/friendly.php?s=harvard</a> • Use one and a half or double spacing for text. • Text should be 12pts and an easy to read font such as Times New Roman, Arial or Calibri. • Denote new paragraphs by indenting the first line with the tab key. • Do not leave line spaces between paragraphs. • Leave one space after full stops (between sentences). • Use page numbers to ensure that your work stays in order. • Provide word counts where requested. Word counts are firm. There is no 10% lee-way. Please include a word count on your assignment. For written pieces, especially essays, word limit counts should include all quotations and in-text references but exclude footnotes and references/bibliography. Information central to your argument should not be in footnotes and abuse of footnotes (i.e. containing long quotes) will be noted. An essay or report should have more than 10 academic references, drawing on relevant sources and used in a meaningful way. An exegesis submitted alongside a creative piece should have a minimum of 4 academic references, used in a meaningful way. The creative piece should demonstrate your engagement with these sources.</p></pre>

However there are some conditions that apply to Creative Pieces.  This mode is being reintroduced in 2019 following feedback in 2018. This should not be considered an easy option and is in some ways more difficult. This mode is only able to be allocated minimal technical support in 2019 so students should select it with caution, and if they select it must attend all Arts Digital Learning team workshops to support their decision. This mode requires a very high level of independence and project management and is recommended only for students who are working at Distinction level or above in most of their units and have strong confidence in their media production abilities. Students are asked to submit an exegesis alongside their creative piece. Guidelines regarding Creative Pieces will be available on the LMS.</p></pre>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
