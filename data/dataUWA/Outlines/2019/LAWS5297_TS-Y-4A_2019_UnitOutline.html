                                    <td>This unit focuses on international and transnational practice. It takes students beyond the traditional Australian and common law concentration. Students are introduced to legal systems from other countries, explore strategies for international research, and develop skills necessary to practice in different cultures and systems, and to interact with clients and lawyers from other jurisdictions.

This unit aims to introduce students to the increasingly important implications of practicing global law, and understanding the impact of digital technologies in legal practice and in the lawyer's own professional identity, including the impact of social media. It seeks to make students aware of the opportunities in international practice as the role of traditional lawyering is broadened, as well as the responsibilities of being a global, digital lawyer. 

Students start by exploring the origin of transnational practice, highlighting the importance of today's lawyer engaging in global practice. They are then introduced to the ethical concerns and responsibilities involved in being an international lawyer, before moving onto an overview of the domestic legal systems of important players in the international legal arena. A discussion of the impact of global legal practice on minorities within the legal community encourages students to think of the larger socio-economic implications of cross-border practice. International management and firm operation is dealt with as students are challenged with the problem of how to maintain local identity while providing international service.</td>

Students will be introduced to legal systems from other countries, explore strategies for international research, and develop skills necessary to practice in different cultures and systems, and to interact with clients and lawyers from other jurisdictions.
This unit aims to introduce students to the increasingly important implications of practicing global law, and understanding the impact of digital technologies in legal practice, and in the lawyer's own professional identity, including the impact of social media. It seeks to make students aware of the opportunities in international practice as the role of traditional lawyering is broadened, as well as the responsibilities of being a global, digital lawyer.
Students will start by exploring the origin of transnational practice, highlighting the importance of today's lawyer engaging in global practice. Students will then be introduced to the ethical concerns and responsibilities involved in being an international lawyer, before moving onto an overview of the domestic legal systems of important players in the international legal arena. A discussion of the impact of global legal practice on minorities within the legal community will encourage students to think of the larger socio-economic implications of cross-border practice. International management and firm operation will be dealt with as students are challenged with the problem of how to maintain local identity while providing international service.</p></pre>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>

UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
