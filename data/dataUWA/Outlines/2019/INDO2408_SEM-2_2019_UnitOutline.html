It is designed to expand students' speaking, reading and writing skills through exposure to film, specialist texts and popular literature. Areas covered in the unit include literary, journalistic and academic Indonesia. Students read a major novel in Indonesian as well as study Indonesian films in detail. The exposure to Indonesian popular media provides students with a valuable window into contemporary language use and contemporary youth culture. Central to the unit is a research project using Indonesian language materials, culminating in an extended academic essay in Indonesian on a contemporary social, cultural or political issue. An in-depth look at a popular film provides a valuable window into contemporary language use and contemporary youth culture. The film also provides a springboard into several issues and debates that are explored in class. Students are able to achieve 'vocational proficiency' or Level 4 of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (Elaine Wylie and D. E. Ingram, Griffith University, 1995).</td>

It is designed to expand students' speaking, reading and writing skills through exposure to film, specialist texts and popular literature. Areas covered in the unit include literary, journalistic and academic Indonesia. Students read a major novel in Indonesian as well as study Indonesian films in detail. The exposure to Indonesian popular media provides students with a valuable window into contemporary language use and contemporary youth culture. Central to the unit is a research project using Indonesian language materials, culminating in an extended academic essay in Indonesian on a contemporary social, cultural or political issue. An in-depth look at a popular film provides a valuable window into contemporary language use and contemporary youth culture. The film also provides a springboard into several issues and debates that are explored in class. Students are able to achieve 'vocational proficiency' or Level 4 of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (Elaine Wylie and D. E. Ingram, Griffith University, 1995).</p></pre>

Learning activities and purpose
In this unit you have three main tasks. One is to read and discuss Saman, a popular Indonesian novel. The second is to watch and discuss Indonesian films. The third is to do a research project using Indonesian language materials, culminating in a research essay and presentation in Indonesian on a contemporary social, cultural or political issue. 

As a contemporary Indonesian work, Saman will expose you to a mixture of Indonesian writing styles. Reading and discussing the book will also expand your vocabulary and develop your comprehension skills. Some sections of the book are challenging, but don’t worry, we’ll get through it together!

The first class of each week will be mainly devoted to film. You will be required to watch two Indonesian films, which will be discussed in class. We will explore the social, cultural and political issues that these films raise. Your comprehension of these films will be tested in the final exam.

Your research project will give you experience in using Indonesian newspapers, academic journals and other sources. Presentations and discussions of your research in class and on LMS (Blackboard) will give you an opportunity to lift your language beyond the level of everyday conversation and use them through different modes of communication. The project will involve an in-class presentation, essay, and discussions on Blackboard. 

You will also receive a participation mark and be required to complete exercises at home (some of which will be marked). See below for details, and check the unit site on LMS on a regular basis. 

Non-contact or home study consists of the following:

1. Preparation for class 
The homework section of your weekly study program lists what you have to do each week. You will also be assigned other exercises as we go. 

2. Assignments
You will be required to submit a book review and a major research assignment, consisting of a 1300 word academic essay in Indonesian (details provided below). Please note that all written work submitted for assessment should be typed and double-spaced in hard copy. (However, handwritten work will be accepted as long as they are legible.)

All assignments are to be dropped off in the appropriate boxes located near the Social Sciences Reception on the ground floor of the Social Sciences Building.

3. LMS participation
You will be required to participate in online exercises on Blackboard. See below for details.	

4. Additional Study and Practice
Take every opportunity to practice your Indonesian and listen to it being spoken! If you are having trouble with some aspect of the language, let me know.

Late submission of Assignments
A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.
For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).
If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.
If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;
Penalty for exceeding word limit
Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.
Academic conduct
Academic Integrity is defined in the University Policy on Academic Conduct as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.
Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.
Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding academic conduct and ethical scholarship at UWA.
Special Considerations
If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:
•	serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend
•	serious injury
•	being a victim of a crime
•	breakdown of relationship
•	sudden loss of income or employment
•	serious disruption to domestic arrangements

Assessment Details

Book review
You will be required to write one book review of approximately 500 words (double spaced) in Indonesian on the novel. It should contain a brief summary of sections of the novel and your reflections on it. See the Study Program section for details.	

Major research project
There is one major assignment for this unit, which will have three parts to it as follows:

1.	Oral presentation. You will each give an oral presentation of 10-15 minutes long on the subject of your assignment. The presentation should be relaxed, intimate, and communicative, i.e. talk to the other students, not to your notes! You are also encouraged to use visual props to engage the interest of other students.

2.	Essay. A 1300 word essay in Indonesian to be handed in on Tuesday of Week 12 (25 October). For this assignment you have to choose a topic in consultation with Bu Theresia and conduct your own research throughout the semester. This should deal with a contemporary social, cultural or political issue which interests you. You need to use at least 3 Indonesian sources (e.g. newspaper articles of reasonable length). Ibu dosen can help direct you to appropriate resources, but have a look first at the web resources below. You will find a wealth of material there because many Indonesian newspapers are available online. Also, don’t, don’t, don’t ever forget the library! 

3.	Blackboard blog. Students will be required to post a blog on Blackboard and post responses to your classmates’ blogs/responses. These exercises have two purposes. The first is to get you thinking and ‘talking’ about Indonesia related topics which interest you. The second is to give you a chance to receive peer feedback on your project. The third is to learn to engage with each other's topic and participate in academic 'conversations'.

You will not be assessed on grammatical accuracy for the blog exercise. You are free to make mistakes! Instead, you will be assessed for participation. You’ll know if you make too many mistakes because your classmates might respond by talking about something different! Then just re-explain what you meant. 

Blog:	
As a blogger, you need to post a blog of approximately 200 words long. (Don’t forget to include a title/heading.) This should be a summary of an article you read in relation to your topic. Where necessary, you also need to respond to any comments / questions posted by your classmates about your blog. Hint: In order to get a critically engaging response, you might want to post a question or two with your blog, or afterwards as you see fit. 

As a responder, you need to post relevant, meaningful responses to your classmates’ blogs. This can be in the form of a constructive critique, suggestion, and/or question. It is an opportunity for the responder to share his/her own opinion/interest on the topic or provide feedback which can be of help to the blogger in writing his/her essay. 

Good marks in this assignment will depend on: 
* Quality and range of research, including interview material
* Critical awareness of the issues you address
* Accuracy and appropriateness of language used, including spelling, punctuation, sentence structure, grammar and syntax
* How well the paper is structured

Blackboard participation
This refers to your participation in the Blackboard blog component, as well as general discussions (generated by either yourself or your classmates) and other short exercises that come up during the course of the semester. Make sure to check the Blackboard announcement board on a regular basis! Also, feel free to ask questions or start a discussion while you’re there.
