It furthers students' knowledge of the German literary canon from the seventeenth through to the twentieth century. Students also explore issues raised by literary canons, including—How can we explain the rise of some literary texts to canonical status? What is the role played in this process by cultural and historical contexts? Who or what is excluded from such a canon? Are there any common features to canonical literary texts? Are these contested? How did linguistic, literary, cultural traits of such canonical texts evolve over the course of centuries? 

The objectives of the unit are to (1) further German language skills to Level C1/C2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Gemeinsamer Europaischer Referenzrahmen); (2) develop skills in reading, analysing and discussing texts; (3) further develop research skills in German Studies in preparation for further studies; (4) reflect critically on the process leading to the building of literary canons in general, and the German literary canon in particular; and (5) further interpersonal skills and independent learning skills in preparation for postgraduate studies.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>This unit, taught entirely in German, is designed for students who have completed a major in German Studies and work at honours or postgraduate level. It furthers students' knowledge of the German literary canon from the seventeenth through to the twentieth century. Students also explore issues raised by literary canons, including—How can we explain the rise of some literary texts to canonical status? What is the role played in this process by cultural and historical contexts? Who or what is excluded from such a canon? Are there any common features to canonical literary texts? Are these contested? How did linguistic, literary, cultural traits of such canonical texts evolve over the course of centuries? 

The objectives of the unit are to (1) further German language skills to Level C1/C2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Gemeinsamer Europaischer Referenzrahmen); (2) develop skills in reading, analysing and discussing texts; (3) further develop research skills in German Studies in preparation for further studies; (4) reflect critically on the process leading to the building of literary canons in general, and the German literary canon in particular; and (5) further interpersonal skills and independent learning skills in preparation for postgraduate studies.</p></pre>

It integrates speaking, reading and writing, aural comprehension, grammar, and research with materials drawn from German literary, social and cultural history. Students are introduced to central issues in German literature and society from the Romantic periods to Modernity through the study and discussion of selected texts, in order to develop an appreciation for the intricacies of the German language used in older texts. 

The unit leads to either Honours in German Studies or the Masters in Translation Studies.

The academic objectives of GRMN3408 are to further:
- consolidate and improve skills in reading, writing, listening and speaking in the German language;
- increase awareness of intercultural issues using German as an example;
- increase awareness of the English language and how language works in general;
- improve research skills utilising a variety of sources and experiences;
- develop independent learning skills;
- develop interpersonal skills; and
- improve communication skills in a range of contexts both in spoken and written German and English.

Assessment is comprised of individual and group work, and includes formative and summative assessment types. </p></pre>

Your contribution should be a short presentation of an important aspect of German grammar using a text / film or problem of social or literary history in GERMAN from the respective week as the linguistic context. This class paper should present a grammatical phenomenon / problem, discuss and illustrate, and encourage deep learning. Most importantly, this interactive in-class presentation allows for the introduction of a linguistic challenge through authentic texts.
It is necessary to discuss the structure of the ppt slides with me one week prior to the presentation, otherwise 30 points out of 100 will be deducted. To this effect, all the electronic resources should be sent to alexandra.ludewig@uwa.edu.au. 

TRANSLATION PROBLEM (recorded and solo)
These oral presentations will be video-recorded. They should run between 15 and 20 minutes and focus on “Mein Übersetzungsproblem“ Welches Problem bietet, Deiner Meinung nach, eine besondere Herausforderung für Translationen im Bereich Deutsch-Englisch / Englisch-Deutsch in Bezug auf [set weekly topic / text]? Führe sowohl mit einem Überblick über relevante Theorie(n) als auch mit praktischen Beispielen auf das Problem hin und biete Lösungskonzepte und Lernhilfen mit Blick auf interkulturelle Perspektiven an.

CREATIVE ASSESSMENT: INTERACTIVE GAME / ART WORK (LIVE and sole) 
Your creative interpretation of one of the semester’s texts / films / epochs in GERMAN should culminate in an interactive, playful presentation of a text / highly original approach to key passages / ideas / concepts, and instigate discussion, reflection, and deep learning. 
It is necessary to discuss the structure of the presentation and the handout and / or ppt slides with me at least one week prior to the presentation (otherwise –30% / 100%). All creative projects will be presented in class and must be accompanied by an exegesis which should be submitted in writing via email in word.docx format. 

Exegesis for Creative Project / Art Work / Game (akin to a mini-research essay)
Your creative Art Work, Game or Creative Project must be accompanied by an exegesis of a minimum of 300 words in GERMAN. The English word ‘exegesis’ comes from the Greek word meaning explanation or interpretation. In the creative arts, an exegesis is an essay that generally accompanies a student’s creative work, and explains and critically examines the work in light of contemporary theory and creative practice. In German Studies, the purpose of the exegesis is to explain, analyse and contextualize your submission. This means, you should:

EXPLAIN what you set out to do and how the process of planning and creating was approached;
ANALYSE critically why you chose this path and what you hope it will achieve;
CONTEXTUALISE your analysis of your project, especially the research leading up to it and the submitted ‘product’, with references from the cultural and theoretical matrix in which your work operates.

The exegesis is an opportunity to offer an additional and fuller explanation of your creative submission. It allows you to outline the procedures you followed and anything else you are aware of, that can help explain, why you have proceeded in the way you have and produced the creative work in front of us. Through the exegesis you can demonstrate what scholarly ideas have influenced you in which way and show that you have rigorously researched both the theoretical and practical aspects of your work. Writing an exegesis provides you with an avenue to:

REFLECT on the entire process. 

The following structure should be adhered to when writing an exegesis:
1.	An introduction to your work that provides a brief synopsis of what you present and describes the theoretical / conceptual ‘questions’ that you wished to explore.
2.	A discussion of the creative process, including significant observations, challenges, mistakes, and discoveries, by which you arrived at your interpretation.
3.	A brief conclusion that summarises your understanding and outlines the intended learning outcomes for the observer / player / student confronted with your work.

QUIZZES
There will be 4 written tests conducted under proper examination conditions in weeks 4, 6, 8 and 12, which will draw on your knowledge of the discussed aspects of German history, society and culture, as well as grammar covered in the previous weeks.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
