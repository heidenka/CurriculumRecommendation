Personal and professional development is one of the main themes of a health professions degree at UWA. The Faculty document ‘Professional Behaviour for Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences Students’ and associated procedural guidelines has been developed to facilitate a consistent and equitable approach to the recording, monitoring and evaluation of misconduct in the area of professionalism and professional behaviour of all students enrolled in coursework programs of study offered by the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences.
It is recognised that all UWA students are governed by related policies at the University level. It is intended that the Faculty document on Professional Behaviour of Health and Medical Sciences Students be read in conjunction with the UWA Regulations for Student Conduct and Discipline, UWA Policy on Experiential Learning, and UWA Guidelines on Ethical Scholarship, Academic Literacy and Academic Misconduct. Master of Pharmacy students are also to refer to guidelines set by the Pharmacy Board of Australia, the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, the Society for Hospital Pharmacists and other pharmacy professional organisations.
Professional Behaviour in podiatry is based on behaviour that comprises clinical competence, communications skills and ethical behaviour and professionally respectful and responsible attitudes. Podiatry students have certain privileges and responsibilities different from those of other students.  Because of this, different standards of professional behaviour are expected of you.  Podiatry students from the first day of commencing studies are reminded of the important role of professional behaviour.  This plays an important role in maintaining trust amongst patients and the community.
Professional behaviour that comes under this protocol includes:
•        Behaviour in small group sessions – laboratories/ tutorials / workshops
•        Behaviour in lectures and clinical laboratories – punctuality and no talking or whispering while the lecturer is    speaking
•        Attendance at scheduled teaching, learning sessions, internal and external clinics
•        Communications on unit websites, social media and examination papers
•        Communications with faculty staff
•        Conduct in relation to the ethical and professional behaviour expected of a podiatric student at UWA
 
A professional approach to the practice of podiatry should be reflected in the appearance and conduct of the student practitioner.
During clinical sessions, students must demonstrate professional presentation and conduct by:
•      Attending clinic sessions in clean, neat and presentable clinical clothes
•      Ensuring punctual attendance at the clinic, i.e. 15 mins prior to the commencement of clinic.
•      Being prepared for the patient, with appropriate instruments being ready prior to seating the patient
•      Ensuring patient treatment is completed on time and planning of the next visit takes place if appropriate
•      Maintaining rapport and treating clinic personnel with respect
Attendance is compulsory for clinical laboratories, student clinic and external placements.  Attendance will be taken at these compulsory sessions. Students must ensure they have signed in for the teaching sessions where roll is kept.  It is not the responsibility of the tutor or demonstrator.  You will be considered to be absent if you have not signed in for the session.
Students can only miss 1 compulsory session during the semester without a medical certificate.  In the case of illness, a medical certificate (not provided by a family member) must be supplied to the unit coordinator within one week of return to classes.  Any missed tasks will need to be completed by this time. Note that the onus is on the student to make contact regarding absences. If a student misses more than this, he/she will be expected to contact the unit coordinator with an explanation.  A failure to provide a valid explanation, or further missed classes will result in action according to the FMDHS Professional Behaviour Assessment.
Lateness: Students who are consistently late to teaching sessions and clinics (more than 10 minutes) will be marked as late and an explanation will be sought from the student.  Your fellow students and teachers appreciate punctuality which is part of professional behaviour and courtesy. Multiple late arrivals will be managed according to the FHMS Professional Behaviour Assessment. Late arrival at lectures and clinical laboratories is also discourteous and unprofessional. If you are unavoidably late, it is important that you do not enter a lecture theatre by the front entrance.
Adherence to rostered session times: It is critical that where a student is assigned to attend a particular session at a particular time, only that session may be attended. Students are not to attend non-assigned sessions for their convenience. Students doing so will be subject to the FMDHS Professional Behaviour Assessment process.
Patient confidentiality. As podiatry students you are of course not only free to discuss your experiences with each other, but you are actually encouraged to do so. Some teaching may involve discussion of clinical cases. Do not discuss these where you may be overheard by the public. DO NOT upload information or images regarding clinical cases to social media sites.  It is important to remember that any information you learn about a patient should be regarded as a matter of professional confidence.
Important in any definition of professionalism is acknowledgment of the trust that must exist between the patient and the practitioner. A podiatrist must demonstrate respect of the podiatrist-patient relationship and the implied responsibilities thereof.
Podiatry students must demonstrate professional responsibility by:
•      Providing each patient with adequate and appropriate explanations of intended procedures
•      Understanding and responding appropriately to patients’ needs or concerns
•      Maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of patient records
•      Responding appropriately to any discomfort experienced by the patient
•      Ensuring that following any procedure, the patients’ knowledge and understanding of the performed procedure      is adequate.
 
Professional Competence: An expert level of knowledge, competence and skill in a particular area is expected of a professional person. A podiatrist must demonstrate a professional level of competence through his/her actions.
During clinical sessions, podiatry students must demonstrate professional competence by:
•      Demonstrating correct infection control procedures
•      Complying with all Faculty and Unit policies, guidelines and procedural manuals
•      Showing diagnostic initiative and accuracy
•      Accepting constructive criticism and demonstrating the ability to critique one’s own work
•      Ensuring that patient records are accurate, complete and legible
•      Showing a detailed understanding of the procedures to be undertaken during the session
•      Awareness of patient safety and appropriate use of posture techniques
 
To complement existing University Policies and Standards, the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences has developed a uniform policy on professional behaviour for students.
At all times, students will be expected to review and adhere to the standards as set out in the following:
a.              FHMS Policy on Professional Behaviour for Students: available from the Faculty Webpage <a href='http://www.meddent.uwa.edu.au/teaching/policies/professional-behaviour' target='_blank'>http://www.meddent.uwa.edu.au/teaching/policies/professional-behaviour</a>
b.              UWA’s Regulations for Student Conduct and Discipline: <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/regulations/student-conduct' target='_blank'>http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/regulations/student-conduct</a>
c.               UWA’s Guidelines on Ethical Scholarship, Academic Literacy and Academic Misconduct: www.teachingandlearning.uwa.edu.au/page/59146
Management
All unprofessional behaviour or professional misconduct must be reported. The agreed principles of reporting, investigating and recording unprofessional behavior as outlined in the policy document using the relevant templates will be used in applying these guidelines.
Governance
All reported misconduct will be forwarded for review to the Professional Behaviour Advisory Panel (PBAP) who will monitor the reporting and remediation processes applied by Schools. This panel will be chaired by the Associate Dean (Student Affairs) and will be convened on a per semester basis, reporting directly to the Dean.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
