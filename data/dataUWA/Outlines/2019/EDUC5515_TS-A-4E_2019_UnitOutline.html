Assessment One - Project Proposal Outline (30%)
 
The purpose of a project proposal is to provide an overview of research to those who are not familiar with the topic. A proposal should address the ‘What and Why’ along with the ‘How’ of the planned research. Remember that this is a proposal, so you cannot identify any participants. Some information in the proposal has to be presented in a general manner. The proposal will have five main headings: title, statement of the issue, literature review, methodology and references.
 
The length of the proposal is 2000 words (excluding in-text references, reference list and the 10-day summary of the intervention). This is not many words to work with, so be succinct in your writing. Also, use relevant references rather than many references. Please note that additional information and references can be presented in your final report.
 
A. Title
The title should have meaning and convey as much information as possible about the proposed classroom-based research in as few words as possible.
 
B. Statement of the issue
Summarise in one paragraph the issue that is being researched and why it is important. Clearly state the aim of your research. Provide some theoretical contextual information (for example, ‘historical literacy is important because …’) and classroom contextual information (for example, ‘a number of Year 11 students in my practicum school experience difficulty when writing historical narratives’) to explain why you chose this issue and why it is important. This information has to be written in a manner that does not identify the participants or schools.
 
C. Literature Review
The function of the literature in the proposal is to locate the present study, and to explain and justify the directions it proposes to take. Identify, describe and start to critically review literature which is relevant to the research. Use subheadings as appropriate within the Literature Review to guide the reader. There should be two or three subheadings that link to the key concepts in your title and research question. Provide sign posts at the start of the literature review to inform the reader of what is to come.
 
D. Methodology
This consists of seven subsections. Use these subheadings in your proposal:
 a) Action research - Provide a short, referenced description of action research. Consider justifying why action research is the appropriate approach for your intervention. Point out the cyclical nature of action research and what that means for the future potential of this intervention. This will be expanded in the final report;
b) Research questions
State one specific overarching research question that you will try and answer through your classroom-based research. This question should relate to the title;
c) Possible participants and site What are the characteristics of the students who will be invited to participate in your classroom-based research? How many participants might you have? State a range (for example, two to four Year 8 students). Where will they be from (type of school and geographical area – do not name a specific school)? Why and how will they be selected? Write this section as a generalisation and in the future tense, as you are not supposed to have identified any potential participants yet;
d) Intervention What is the planned intervention? Include the number of days and the length of sessions. Provide an overview of your planned intervention within the body of the proposal that summarises the general structure. As an appendix, present a 10-day summary table that clearly states what you will do on each day of the intervention. This should highlight the range of teaching and learning strategies to be used, along with assessments.
e) Data collection What methods will you use to collect data? Consider the use of a standardised test, modified test, or a teacher made test (pre-test and post-test); questionnaire; conversations with children; interview with the teacher, teacher aide or parent; classroom observation; or your own field notes. How will each method contribute to answering your research question? What procedures will be used to administer these methods? Include an adequate description of what information you plan to collect from the methods you have chosen. Justify your decisions. For example, if you state you are audio-recording, exactly what will you be audio-recording? If you are using a test, exactly what is the test measuring?;
f) Data analysis How will the data be analysed? If you plan to collect quantitative data, some form of statistical procedures should be used. This could be as simple as pre- and post- total scores placed onto a column graph and compared. If you plan to collect qualitative data, you may have to look for common themes that emerge from the data. Give references to support your choices;
g) Ethical considerations All social research involves consent, access and associated ethical issues. What ethical issues are involved in the project, and how will you deal with me? Remember that you also need to submit a hard copy of the completed Students Course Based Ethics Approval form that can be found in the Ethics folder, which is located on the left-hand-side of LMS.

Assessment Two – Final Report as a Journal Article (70%)

In this final report you are to present your intervention in the form of a journal article. Once you have collected and analysed data from a research project, it is important to present all your information in an appropriate manner. Thus, sections of your report will cover the Abstract, Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Findings, Conclusion, Acknowledgements, and References. The report should be approximately 4,500 words long. It should be presented in Times New Roman and1 ½ spacing. Include a footer that has the page number and a header that states your name and student number. Remember to use pseudonyms (for participants and for the school) throughout the report. See Chapter 1 of Bell et al. (2014) for information on communicating action research projects. See also the NFER guide How to Run Action Research, which is located in the Research Guides folder on LMS.

Abstract (5 marks) (approx. 150-200 words)
The abstract provides a brief summary of the whole paper in one paragraph. It does not include any references. It should succinctly address the what (aims/purpose), why (it is significant), and how (participants, site, and methods of data collection) of the action research project. It should summarise the findings, present a conclusion and make a major recommendation for further action. Remember to mention that this is an action research project. 

Introduction (5 marks) (approx. 150-200 words)
The introduction should provide the theoretical context for the research. It should highlight why this area of research is important. For example, what are the general benefits of improving the topic of your intervention (such as spelling, multiplication or fluency). This is NOT the same as the ‘Statement of inquiry’ from the proposal. The last sentence of the Introduction should state the purpose of the research.

Literature Review (25 marks) (approx. 1500-2000 words)
The first paragraph should provide clear signposts of what sections are to be reviewed.
What does the research say about the issue? Make sure that you include major, important and current peer-reviewed research. Primary references should be used where possible. Summarise empirical studies that are relevant.
Ensure your review includes critique – what are the strengths and limitations of the research reviewed?
Finish the Literature Review with a paragraph that summarise the gaps and/or controversies in the literature. The identified gap should then clearly link to your research.

Methodology (10 marks) (approx. 700 words)
The methodology should include the following subsections. Use subheadings for each of these: a) Design: Provide a short description of action research and its cycle; b) The research question; c) Participants and site: Use pseudonyms (not letters of the alphabet) for the participants and a general description of the location of the school. Any information from the teacher interview about the participants goes here; d) Methods of data collection and analysis: All forms of data collection should be described here. Describe and justify any modifications made to established tests; e) Description of intervention: Summarise the intervention in words. The 10-day summary table is not to be presented in the final report; f) Ethical considerations

Findings and Discussion (15 marks) (approx. 800-1000 words)
Start with a general sentence that summarises the success (or otherwise) of the intervention. Describe the findings of your research project in a logical manner. For example, if you had two participants, you may want to present the findings individually and then discuss the overall results. Alternatively, you may want to present quantitative data first, followed by qualitative data. The basic thing to remember is that you are telling a story about your participants, using appropriate evidence from the intervention. This requires you to be familiar with your data, identify ‘critical events’, and then summarise and synthesise the information.  Display and explain your data and discuss what it means. Display your results as either a table or graph, but NOT as both. Consider placing pre- and post-test results on the same table or graph to highlight the differences. Some information may be better explained in sentences and may not need a table or graph. Photographs should be used sparingly, if at all. Please note that the correct APA terms are ‘tables’ or ‘figures’ – not ‘graphs’ or ‘charts’. Discuss any limitations of your research.
Remember that this is action research and is aimed at a small group of people in one classroom. A small sample size and inability to generalise are not limitations.

Conclusion (5 marks) (approx. 200-400 words)
Your conclusion should summarise your research, point out why it is significant or useful, and discuss any implications. What suggestions would you make for the next phase of the action research cycle with your participants, if it were to continue at the school?

Presentation and referencing (5 marks)
You will be assessed on your: a) Written expression, including spelling, grammar and cohesion. Please write in the past tense as the research has been done. Do not say “The researcher used a diagnostic…”. Rather, state “Diagnostic assessment was used…”; b) Correct APA referencing. Click here for the UWA APA Referencing Guide.
Your Project Proposal can act as the first draft of this final report; however it will require extensive editing. Appropriate length (4500 words). Other than the parent report (see below), we do not wish to see any appendices. You are expected to summarise all raw data and present it in an appropriate manner (table or graph) in the Findings section of your report.

Other mandatory information that must be submitted to pass the assignment.
a) Parental report: One page summary for parents included as an Appendix to the Final Report. Remember your audience - be succinct in what you say and try to limit the report to one page. This will be the last page of your report. This does not need to be de-identified. You will find a template for this in the Assessment 2 folder;  b) Signed consent forms from parents, teacher and participants. These are to be handed in as hard copies to the lecturer who marked your Project Proposal. These can be placed in the coordinator’s pigeon hole; c) All data needs to be turned over to the lecturers for ethics compliance reasons (for example, all notes, journals, or interview transcripts). Scan your data and submit electronically through LMS. This data should be de-identified. Delete all data from your computer before you leave UWA.

RESUBMISSION RULE: 

Failure to pass an assessment item within a unit (MTeach)
15. Students must pass all components of a Master of Teaching unit to pass the unit overall. Students who fail an assessment item in a unit may resubmit it if—
a) this is their first request for a resubmission in the unit;
b) they contact the unit coordinator by email within 5 University working days of the release of the result and formally request a resubmission.
c) A resubmitted assignment that is deemed to be a ‘fail’ by the unit coordinator, will receive the original failing mark for the component.
d) Where resubmission is approved, the reassessed mark is capped at the assessment pass mark, unless an application for mitigation is approved in accordance with the University Policy on Assessment: Special Consideration (UP11/23).
e) A resubmission is normally due one week after being approved by the unit coordinator.
f) Assignments that are failed on the grounds of lateness or academic misconduct will not normally be considered for resubmission.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
