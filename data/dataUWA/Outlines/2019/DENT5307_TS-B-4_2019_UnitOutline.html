Learning outcomes
Students are able to (1) formulate an initial diagnosis and initial case assessment; (2) evaluate treatment options and discuss these clearly with the patient; (3) formulate a definitive treatment program; (4) implement all stages of the treatment program; (5) evaluate the outcome of treatment on completion of the treatment program against the initial stated objective and at developing; (6) implement a future clinical pathway for the long-term monitoring and maintenance of the case; (7) explain aesthetic principles, such as unity and variety, balance, emphasis and focal point, rhythm, scale and proportion; (8) describe the basic colour theories; (9) select the shade for the restorations; and (10) correct extrinsic and intrinsic staining of teeth.

 There are 2 modules described in this unit Complex Oral Rehabilition 2 and Dento-facial Aesthetics.  For practical purposes, the teaching and assessments in these 2 modules have been combined.  However on the timetable and lecture schedule, you may notice that there may be reference to both of these modules.

The student will be required to undergo remediation during the suspension period.

Any student found to be deviating from the established protocols in the clinic will be considered to have demonstrated a lack of professionalism and this will be addressed under the professionalism policy. Where the deviation endangers patient safety suspension from clinic may occur.

Attendance at all lectures, rostered clinics, practical sessions, seminars and training workshops is compulsory and failure to attend

may result in the need to attend further clinical sessions and remediation in terms of professionalism.ï¿½ See the UWA Dental School handbook for further information on attendance and leave policy.

Changes to the rosters are not permitted unless due to exceptional circumstances. Any proposed changes to the rosters must be discussed and agreed to by the unit/module coordinator prior to the rostered session.

A clinical score will be given, expressed as a percentage grade. Calculation of this score is determined by the Clinical Assessment System- COEUS, from tutor assigned grades following clinical procedures undertaken by students. Students should familiarise themselves with the assessment criteria and grading system as will be circulated during Block Teaching Week.

Clinical practice and experience is essential to ensure your progression in this unit, DMD course and future career. From 2018, Minimum Clinical Experience will apply. See the relevant attachment on LMS for further details on this Students must ensure they have an adequate pool of patients with sufficient clinical work to have exposure to a wide variety of clinical procedures and techniques.

Students are expected to have a level of technical understanding and skill to support the clinical work they are undertaking. Where assistance is required for laboratory and technical procedures this support will be provided by a combination of UWA Dental School/OHCWA staff in conjunction with external laboratories contracted to OHCWA where appropriate. Where technical work is undertaken by individual students, under supervision, priority is on completing the work in a safe manner to a high standard.

 
Progress Monitors and Laboratory Work Authorization
DMD3 Progress monitor forms and laboratory work authorization sheets are a quality check and feedback mechanism to ensure appropriate clinical and laboratory stages are undertaken and to communicate with the laboratory, respectively. Progress monitors record both clinical and laboratory stages of any indirect clinical procedures.

Laboratory work authorisation assessment sheets must be signed in and out of the laboratory by appropriate staff and retained for collation at the end of the year.

It is each student's responsibility to seek signatures, compiling them in a logbook and submitting these forms following completion of treatment or at the end of the clinical year.

No work may enter the clinic until this has been assessed as satisfactory by the authorised laboratory staff member.

Failure to submit correctly signed progress monitors and worksheets is a serious breach of protocol and will render loss of credit for the relevant clinical case. This has implications for failure of the clinical component of this unit.

 

Remediation/ Feedback
Feedback is provided by the unit coordinator and/or the module coordinator on a one on one basis or as a group on assignments within four weeks of deadline for submission with the exception of summative examination at the end of the unit. Students choosing to discuss his/her performance should make an appointment to see the unit coordinator within four weeks after the release of marks/grades. The purpose of feedback will be to identify what remediation strategies can help the student to improve.

Remediation in essential generic skills and knowledge may be offered to poorly performing students to specific learning outcomes that have been identified by the unit or module coordinator as not having been achieved as early in the unit/course as possible and student progress is monitored. Remediation can be in the form of supervised clinical work, written assignments, independent study as and when required. Remediation is not a reassessment and does not affect the student's marks.

 
Supplementary Assessment
Please refer to the UWA Dental School Handbook for current information on the supplementary assessment policy.

If a student has not performed well enough in the written examination to achieve an outright Pass in that exam, then he/she may be required to undertake a Viva Voce (oral) examination or do other work for further assessment (remedial practical work and exercises, etc). Hence, students should ensure that they can be readily contacted by UWA Dental School staff and that they are available to attend such examinations at short notice. Further assessments can be scheduled at any time prior to the BoE meeting which is held in July/December. This is why the School does not recommend students leave prior to the Board of Examiners.

All Students MUST ensure that they can be contacted by the School and that they are available to attend any further assessments at short notice during the University's examination period which extends to the day the Board of Examiners in Dentistry meets. If a student fails a component and a supplementary examination is granted by the board the student must be available on the date scheduled. Dates for the Board of Examiners meeting and Supplementary period are circulated by UWA Dental School Administration/UWA Student Administration.

It is each student's responsibility to ensure they are readily available should further assessments be required. Bookings for overseas or inter-state holidays or any other reason will not be accepted as a valid excuse for failure to attend impromptu assessments or supplementary examinations during the official examination period as defined above.</p></pre>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
