This unit introduces the standard C programming language, on which many other programming languages and systems are based, through a study of core operating system services including input and output, memory management and file systems. The C language is introduced through discussions on basic topics like data types, variables, expressions, control structures, scoping rules, functions and parameter passing. More advanced topics like C’s run-time environment, system calls, dynamic memory allocation, pointers and recursion are presented in the context of operating system services related to process execution, memory management and file systems. The importance of process scheduling, memory management and interprocess communication in modern operating systems is discussed in the context of operating system support for multiprogramming. Laboratory and tutorial work place a strong focus on the practical application of fundamental programming concepts, with examples designed to compare and contrast many key features of contemporary operating systems.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>Understanding the relationship between a programming language and the contemporary operating systems on which it executes is central to developing many skills in Computer Science. This unit introduces the standard C programming language, on which many other programming languages and systems are based, through a study of core operating system services including input and output, memory management and file systems. The C language is introduced through discussions on basic topics like data types, variables, expressions, control structures, scoping rules, functions and parameter passing. More advanced topics like C’s run-time environment, system calls, dynamic memory allocation, and pointers are presented in the context of operating system services related to process execution, memory management and file systems. The importance of process scheduling, memory management and interprocess communication in modern operating systems is discussed in the context of operating system support for multiprogramming. Laboratory and workshop exercises place a strong focus on the practical application of fundamental programming concepts, with examples designed to compare and contrast many key features of contemporary operating systems.</p></pre>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre>
                    <h3>Teaching and Learning Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>The unit is presented in a face-to-face manner, with two 45 minute lectures each week, and one 45 minute workshop session in most weeks. Each student will also need to undertake 4-6 hours of practical/laboratory work each week.

Extensive use will be made of the help2002 online forum, for formal announcements and for students to ask and receive replies about any aspect of the unit.  Students are encouraged to read the forum at least twice a week to keep up-to-date with the unit's material and assistance.

The rights and responsibilities of students enrolled in the unit are fully explained in UWA's "University charter of student rights and responsibilities" - <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP07/132' target='_blank'>http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP07/132</a></p></pre>
                    <h3>Unit Structure</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>The unit is presented in a face-to-face manner, with two 45 minute lectures each week, and one 45 minute workshop session in most weeks. Although lectures and workshops will be recorded via LCS, the recordings should be considered as an opportunity to review the unit's material, and not as the first exposure to the material.

Workshops reiterate the material introduced in the lectures and are aimed as review exercises for students who need extra assistance in understanding unit material. Workshops are held in a standard lecture venue, and little new material is introduced. Students should use these sessions to ask questions about the lecture material and to seek assistance in solving the week's workshop exercises. Students should attempt these exercises before attending the workshop.

Each student will need to undertake 4-6 hours of practical/laboratory work each week. The unit does not have compulsory laboratory sessions that are allocated through CAS. Instead, there are a number of 2 hour laboratory periods each week at which students will be able to gain assistance from a laboratory demonstrator. Students are encouraged to attend at least one of these sessions each week to informally assess their progress.

Students may choose to undertake each project individually, or with one other student.

In accordance with the University Guidelines on Academic Conduct policy, students may discuss with other students and educators the general principles required to understand the projects, but the work you submit must be your own and (at your choice) that of your project partner.

Students may use material and code from external sources, such as from StackOverflow, but only with proper attribution.  See <a href='http://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code' target='_blank'>http://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code</a> for expectations on referencing sources in programming projects.

Programming projects will be checked for indications of excessive collusion and students suspected of academic misconduct will be referred to the Academic Conduct Advisor.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
