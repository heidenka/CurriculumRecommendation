It falls into four main parts: (1) an examination of the contract of employment and the individual employment relationship, focusing on the formation, operation and termination of contracts of service including, in particular, various common law duties of employers and employees; (2) the federal and state legal systems of industrial relations that provide for the regulation of conditions of work including a discussion of arbitrated awards and collectively negotiated agreements, and an examination of how these industrial instruments affect the contract of employment and the individual employment relationship; (3) an examination of how the law endeavours to deal with and regulate industrial conflict, with particular attention given to the existing rules concerning protected industrial action; and (4) an overview of the law of occupational health and safety, including the principal methods of compensating employees injured at work (especially workers' compensation).</p></pre>

It is expected that students have an adequate command of:

    English and related communication skills – students are expected to have very high English language skills and to be able to understand and follow the principles of accepted expression and style.
    Information literacy skills – work with computers, whether for word processing or for legal research, are an important aspect of studying law; students are expected to have and to further develop the relevant skills. 


If you are not well prepared in any of the above areas you should make every effort to remedy the situation through undertaking additional reading and/or practice. Do not hesitate to ask for advice from your teacher.

The University’s Student Learning, Research and Language Skills Service offers assistance in a variety of areas, including writing skills, study skills, examination preparation and stress management.

Lectures will be recorded but workshops and seminars will not be recorded.  Many of the classes are intended to be interactive and socratic rather than expository in nature and these workshop classes will not be recorded.

Extensive notes on each topic that is covered in class are posted weekly on LMS to supplement the relevant sections of the textbook, Stewart's Guide to Employment Law, 6th ed (2018). These 'lecture notes' are made available to provide a foundation for further readings, and a consideration of the materials dealt with or referred to in class. </p></pre>

It is important that you therefore attend classes. More formally, the University regulations state that ‘to complete a course or unit students shall attend prescribed classes, lectures, seminars and tutorials’. Where a student, due to particular circumstances, is unable to attend a scheduled class, they should seek the approval of the unit coordinator to be absent from that class. Any student absent from class without having had such absence approved by the unit coordinator, may be referred to the faculty for advice. Repeated absences may result in the student being required to withdraw from the unit.

Marks are accrued by students for actively participating on a regular basis in class discussions.

The class presentations will involve a short oral presentation and discussion of no more than 15 minutes analysing a case, statutory provision or topic assigned in class by the unit co-ordinator.

Each group will be comprised of 5 (or at most 6) students.  The groups will be required to submit a written outline of their analysis prior to the oral presentation.</p></pre>

In response to the inequality of bargaining power between employer and employee, there is now a significant degree of legal regulation of the employment relationship. On the one hand, regulation allows employees to use collective action (trade union formation; collective bargaining; and even industrial action under certain circumstances)to secure and improve their conditions. On the other hand, regulation imposes particular obligations on employers to ensure protection of employees. By the same token, employees also have certain obligations imposed on them by law.

A complex web of legal rules and principles regulate the employment relationship. The sources of these rules and principles include the general (common) law; the contract of employment; individual and collective agreements; arbitrated awards; Federal, State and Territory legislation; and international labour standards. It is important to understand how these sources interact, and in particular how the rules and principles they have generated affect the employment relationship and determine the various rights and duties of employers and employees.

TOPIC 2:  Engaging Labour
- the wage/work bargain; importance of contract law; some fundamental concepts in contract; arrangements for the performance of work (permanent, fractional, part-time, casual etc.)
- characterising work relationships (employer/employee, principal/independent contractors etc); why differences in the nature of work relationships are important; distinguishing between contracts of service (employees) and contracts for services (independent contractors)
- unlawful discrimination in employment (particularly on grounds of sex or age)

See A Stewart, Stewart’s Guide to Employment Law 6th edition, ch 3-5, 14. The starting point is a consideration of why it is scene as fundamentally important to distinguish between the contract of employment and other work relationships - the focus being on the impact of the common law and legislation on the rights and duties of employers and employees. The distinction between employees and persons who work in other capacities (such as independent contractors) concerns questions of 'characterisation' and is usually treated as limited to differentiating between contracts of employment (also known as contracts of service) and contracts for services. Although this is an understandable over-simplification, it is certainly true that over the years the courts have developed various tests for determining whether a person is working as an employee or as an independent contractor. Nowadays a multi-factor test is commonly used for this purpose. It involves a considerable range of different criterias, some more obvious and easily understood than others. In practice though the test is often difficult to apply outside straightforward of situations.

Specific rules apply to special types of employment. The operation of those rules inevitably reflect a degree of flexibility. This flexibility is seen as desirable from a regulatory perspective. There has been, for instance, a significant use of casual labour in recent decades. Awards, enterprise agreements and other employment laws (for example, the Fair Work Act 2009) contain special provisions regulating casual labour, and establishing the rights and duties of employers and those (casual) employees. Outworkers and agency employment (ie relationships based on a labour-hire agreement, involving an employer, a worker and a client) are also subject to special arrangements.

In the hiring of employees contract law usually plays a pivotal role. It is subject though to important legislative provisions. The common law of contract certainly specifies many of the conditions for entering into a valid employment agreement. However, there are important statutory constraints on work arrangements, particularly so-called 'anti-discrimination' legislation. Modern labour laws invariably prohibit discrimination on a number of specified grounds (such as gender, age, disability, religion and race). It is important to consider how these prohibitions are applied to the employment relationship. This involves in particular some appreciation of the nature and significance of the distinction between direct and indirect discrimination. State and federal legislation contain provisions governing unlawful discrimination and provide specific remedies for breach of relevant prohibitions.

TOPIC 3:  Regulating conditions of employment by means of contract.
The content of employment contracts: express terms; implied terms; common law rights and duties of employers and employees, including the importance of statutory protections; health and safety at the workplace.

See A Stewart, Stewart’s Guide to Employment Law 6th edition, ch 6-7, 10-13, 15. Terms of the employment contract may be expressly agreed by the parties, or they may be implied by courts and tribunals. The most prominent types of implied terms are terms implied by law and terms implied in fact. Terms implied in law are certain common law rights and duties of the parties (see below) which for various reasons are automatically treated as being elements of the employment contract unless the parties have agreed otherwise. Terms implied are in fact terms that the courts presume the parties would have intended to be part of the agreement, had they actually thought about them when they made the contract. Interpreting ('construing') explicit contractual provisions can often be a difficult exercise, as even when an a written agreement is apparently complete and comprehensive the parties do not always express themselves clearly. For example, a contract of employment may contain conflicting terms, or one of the parties may claim that in addition to the written contractual provisions other oral assurances or undertakings were also given. Should these other 'promises' be taken into account by a court or an arbitrator? A very important related question is whether management drafted workplace policies and procedures can or should have any contractual force.

The common law makes provision for a range of employer and employee duties, often in the form of implied terms as mentioned above. Employer duties generally include the payment of wages in return for work performed (the work-wage bargain), unless other special arrangements apply. Does this mean that actual work has to be provided to the employee, to enable him/her to retain his/her skills or competence? Employers also owe employees a duty of care (especially in relation to workplace safety and health - discussed below). But do they also  have a legal obligation to act fairly and reasonably towards their employees? The duties of employees include the duty to comply with the employer's lawful and reasonable directions (the duty of 'obedience'), to conduct themselves properly, to exercise care and skill, and to serve their employer faithfully (the duty of 'fidelity'). In practice, these various duties raise many difficult questions - such as when an employer's direction can be regarded as unreasonable, and the level of skill and competence that is required of an employee (given their particular job).

Minimum employment standards are contained in modern awards and enterprise agreements as well as in statutory provisions. The National Employment Standards (NES) in the Fair Work Act (FWA) prevail over inconsistent provisions in any employment contract, award or enterprise agreement. Minimum wages are governed by modern awards, with a separate minimum wage mechanism for award-free employees.

Although workplace health and safety, to some extent is covered by a common law duty (duty of care), extensive regulation by statute has greatly extended this area of law. Traditionally federal and state governments have their own separate legislation. The attempt to harmonise health and safety laws across Australia culminated in the Model Work Health and Safety Act of 2010. Several States have used this model as a template to reform their statutory arrangements.

TOPIC 4:  Ending the employment relationship (including remedies for terminations)
- terminating contracts by giving notice or by rejecting performance on the basis that the performance by the employee (or employees) is inconsistent with contractual obligations
- unfair and unlawful dismissal under State and Federal industrial legislation (Industrial Relations Act 1979 (WA) and the FairWork Act 2009 (Cth)

See A Stewart, Stewart’s Guide to Employment Law 6th edition, ch 16-17. There are variety of ways in which the employment contract can end. Some employment contracts expire automatically. Otherwise they can terminate with or without the consent of the parties or by operation of law. The common law framework applicable to these different types of termination exists alongside and interact with the statutory framework. The statutory provisions often override or modify the common law position. A termination may be voluntary, in that the parties agree to end the contract, or the employee decides to resign. The reason for the termination however might be more complicated - in that, for example, continuation of the employment relationship became intolerable. The question, therefore, in the case of employees who resigns whether they can establish that that they should be treated as having been dismissed. Most contracts of employment make provision for termination by the giving of a specified period of notice. However, contracts that do not contain such a provision can give rise to disagreement about what constitutes reasonable notice. In the modern era, statutes often prescribe minimum notice periods, for employment contracts.

At common law, a serious breach of contract on the part of the employee entitles the employer to terminate the employment without notice (referred to as 'summary dismissal' or 'dismissal for cause'). But when will a breach be regarded as sufficiently serious to justify dismissal? If termination for breach is not justified the dismissal is said to be 'wrongful', and (in theory at least) the employee has certain remedies available. On the other hand, if an employer cannot or does not wish to dismiss an errant employee, is the employee able to be lawfully disciplined, in some other way?

Redundancy is a specific basis for terminating employment. Provisions covering the dismissal of redundant employees are contained in both federal and state industrial legislation. When can it be said that a job or position has been lawfully abolished? What procedures does an employer have to follow? What are the entitlements (monetary and non-monetary) of employees who are made redundant?

The common law provides for a range of remedies in the event of 'repudiation' of the contract by the employer. These include specific performance (but only rarely) and damages (if the employee accepts the repudiation and ends the contract). At common law, courts seldom order specific performance ("reinstatement"), and certain requirements have to be met for damages claims to succeed. How are these requirements applied in practice? Is an award of damages available for psychiatric injury caused by behaviour at work?

Wrongful termination as discussed above can also occur where a dismissal contravenes certain prohibited grounds contained in legislation. The dismissed employee may then have certain remedies at their disposal. However, federal legislation (Fair Work Act 2009) and state legislation (Industrial Relations Act 1979 (WA)) specifically provide actions and remedies for unfair or unlawful dismissal. These particular provisions are intended to address perceived deficiencies in the common law - especially the ability of the employer to dismiss an employee by giving notice. At common law such notice is effective even if no good reason for the termination exists and/or no fair procedure is followed. So, for example, a dismissal which is not 'wrongful' (at common law) might nevertheless be unfair in the sense of being "harsh, unjust or unreasonable" (the formulation that appears in the Fair Work Act). The unfairness of the dismissal might be a consequence of the reason relied on and/or the procedure used. The statutory remedies for unfair dismissal take the form of reinstatement or (much more commonly in practice) monetary compensation.

TOPIC 5:  Regulating employment conditions by means of industrial instruments
- Awards; the nature and significance of awards (including so-called “modern awards” under the FW Act 2009) and the powers of the State and Federal industrial tribunals
- Collectively bargained agreements; enterprise bargaining and the different models of collective agreements at the State and Federal levels (called, respectively, “Industrial Agreements” and “Enterprise Agreements”)
- Individual agreements; the debate about the desirability of different forms of individual agreements that have been available under State and Federal statutes (and their relationship to strategies of improved HRM and/or de-unionisation)
- The role of industrial action in negotiating collective agreements.

See A Stewart, Stewart’s Guide to Employment Law 6th edition, ch 7-8. During the past decade the century old federal award system in Australia has been simplified and modernised. Under the Fair Work Act 2009 the content and operation of all modern awards have to be reviewed every 4 years. For obvious reasons, award wage rates and the National Minimum Wage are reviewed annually. In certain circumstances the Fair Work Commission can revoke or vary those modern awards. The statutory modern awards objective states that modern awards, together with the National Employment Standards, are designed to provide a "fair and reasonable minimum safety net of terms and conditions" of employment. The Fair Work Commission has a responsibility for ensuring that this objective is achieved.

Collective bargaining is entrenched as an essential method of regulating the employment relationship through collective agreements. While State legislation governs State industrial agreements, federal enterprise agreements are governed by the provisions of the Fair Work Act. That statute draws an important distinction between single and multiple enterprise agreements. These are very different from "greenfields agreements" which can only cover new enterprises. How do the parties ensure that they comply with the conditions for making agreements? Specially important in this regard is the "better off overall test" ('BOOT') designed to offer a limited degree of protection to employees. What matters can be regulated by an enterprise agreement? Why must they make provision for Individual Flexibility Agreements, and what protections exist for individual employees who enter into such arrangements?  When can parties take industrial action to bring about an agreed outcome?  What is the role and the limits of "protected (industrial) action"?

TOPIC 6:  Negotiating industrial instruments:  taking industrial action
 - Negotiation (contrasted with conciliation/arbitration)
- Good faith bargaining under the IR Act 1979 (WA) and the FW Act 2009 (Cth)
- Protected industrial action under the FW Act 2009 (Cth)
- Remedies for breach of the various State and Federal industrial instruments (awards, collective agreements and individual agreements)

See A Stewart, Stewart’s Guide to Employment Law 6th edition, ch 8-9, 18. The Fair Work Commission is given the power to conciliate and mediate disputes and, in certain circumstances and as a last resort, to arbitrate a settlement. The Fair Work Act imposes bargaining duties on employers and employees (and relevant unions) covered by the Act. All parties are obliged (when bargaining) to do so 'in good faith'. What does this mean and what is the FWC able to do to try to ensure that this obligation is observed, and that the parties reach an agreement?

Industrial action can take many forms. In addition to industrial action by employees (strikes and work bans), employers may also in some circumstances lock employees out. What is required of employees (and their union) and employers respectively  so as to make industrial action that is taken or planned 'protected industrial action'? Can a union or an employee (or even for that matter an employer) be held liable for engaging in industrial action that is not protected under the Act? Can employees be dismissed or disciplined for taking unprotected (or perhaps even protected) industrial action, and is the employer entitled to withhold wages that are otherwise payable? Under certain circumstances Fair Work Australia may order that industrial action be suspended or terminated, or not taken in the first place. When such an order is made how are negotiations to be pursued and finalised if the parties have firmly entrenched expectations and negotiating positions? What is the significance in this context of the FWCs power to make 'workplace determinations'? Are workplace determinations just other forms of arbitrated modern award?
