How do we 'see' and 'know' nature? How do we describe and experience it? Two lenses are used to examine these questions. The first is Indigenous perspectives starting from creation in the Dreaming to understandings of the environment. The second lens is the science of natural history. The unit explores the discipline's philosophy, techniques and scientific rationale. It features a short lecture series followed by interactive field work in the Albany region during the semester break.</td>

How do we 'see' and 'know' nature? How do we describe and experience it? Two lenses are used to examine these questions. The first is Indigenous perspectives starting from creation in the Dreaming to understandings of the environment. The second lens is the science of natural history. The unit explores the discipline's philosophy, techniques and scientific rationale. It features a short lecture series followed by interactive field work in the Albany region during the semester break.</p></pre>

SEMINARS
Weekly seminars will be presented by presenters knowledgeable in the specific topic, to stimulate critical thinking and to raise questions to increase learning about the concepts offered in each seminar. In preparation for each seminar please analyse materials and note any queries and bring these to the seminar. Opportunities to ask questions will be offered and a dialogue will support the directions the seminar will cover. Completing the Essential Readings/Viewings will enable you to gain deeper understandings of the seminar content.
 
Workshop
Please prepare for your workshops by engaging with the weekly workshop guide and the Essential Readings/Viewings. Workshop tasks will enable students to critically reflect on the
weekly seminar and to contribute openly thoughts and questions regarding the points being raised. The workshops will focus on sharing critical reflections on the week's themes and discussing the questions set for that topic. Class activities will be integrated into the discussion to stimulate further engagement and facilitate deeper understanding.
 
WORKSHOP GUIDES

Workshop guides have been designed to provide some background information on the week’s content and set questions to help guide your reading/viewing. It would be beneficial to consult the workshop guide before you complete your reading/viewing as this will help focus your reading/viewing and you will also be able to engage at a deeper level during workshops discussions and activities.
 
LEARNING ON COUNTRY – FIELD TRIP

Learning on Country is a significant component of learning for Indigenous students/peoples and also for non-Indigenous students/peoples’ learning. Country encompasses more than just the physical environment, it is knowledge, the ancestors, kin/people and spiritual. Learning on Country is a way of learning through connecting with Country and the knowledge within Country.
 
Please note, students will need to participate in all Seminars, and attend/participate in all Workshops and Excursions. Clashes with timetabling and or other unit requirements will need to be solved prior to this unit’s commencement.

Complying to this Student Rule is particularly relevant where a unit may have an attendance, engagement and participation assessment component to its overall unit grade and/or rely on a shared learning experience in or out of the class room as detailed in the unit's outline.

If there is an assessment component for a unit based on tutorial attendance, engagement and participation this will call for an active engagement with all the materials presented in the class whether delivered by staff or by fellow students. Active engagements calls for prior reading and preparation for all classes with questions prepared ahead of time to assist with class discussions and seminar debates. Staff will monitor and document this engagement, as well as ask for seminar feedback during every class to assist with the unit participation assessment. If any student cannot make class then they are advised to email the Unit Coordinator as soon as possible.

Read the guidelines carefully: <a href='https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/Oxford' target='_blank'>https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/Oxford</a> You are required to include footnoted citations and include a reference list. Supportive figures, illustrations used in the essay should be referenced in their titles using footnoted citations. Essays and assignments will be assessed according to the adherence of these referencing standards. Presentation Formats It is recommended that essays be typed. Essay text should be 12 point, in a clear font, e.g. Arial, Helvetica, Times, New York, Palatino or similar, with lines one and one-half spaced. Paragraphs should be denoted by a single extra return (you may indent paragraphs if you wish). Please do not use extraneous formatting, such as headers, footers or tabs if they are not necessary. Please include page numbers. The required length of the essay does not include footnotes. Students must provide a word count at the top of their assessment item at the time of submission. Refer further Essay requirements in the Assessment Brief under Assessments folder on LMS. Important Note: You will be allowed 3 submission attempts so that you can check your Turnitin 'originality report' to ensure you have paraphrased/quoted adequately and acknowledged the sources. Further information on how to do this and on text matching can be found via this link: <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/textmatching/forstudents' target='_blank'>http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/textmatching/forstudents</a>. Plagiarism Academic misconduct includes plagiarism, collusion and other forms of cheating. The University of Western Australia defines Academic Misconduct as "any activity or practice engaged in by a student that breaches explicit guidelines relating to the production of work for assessment, in a manner that compromises or defeats the purpose of that assessment". Plagiarism occurs when someone disguises or misrepresents the authorship of work and claims it as his or her own. It can occur in various forms: (i) presenting, part or whole of another student's essay, design project or artwork as one's own; (ii) copying phrases, sentences or passages from a published source (usually an article or a book) without acknowledging this by quotation marks and a reference; (iii) substantially copying design elements or images from other design projects or artworks, such as to misrepresent the substance, strategy or personal expression of the original design project or artwork; (iii) presenting in your own words an idea, argument or interruption from another source, without indicating the reference Remember always insert references when using other people's ideas. What are the penalties? Plagiarism strikes at the heart of ethical scholarship, and the School has grown increasingly concerned about plagiarism in student essays. In addition to being a form of fraud, plagiarism negates the value of essays, designs or artworks as a means of developing independent thought, analysis, design strategy or creative expression. Unintentional plagiarism will also be penalised. The University views plagiarism very seriously and substantial or repeated plagiarism may result in a student's failing the course or, in extreme cases, being expelled from the University. The defense "but I have done this for other departments or teachers" is unacceptable - it is rather like the driver who, when caught speeding, complains that (s)he hasn't been caught before. How to Avoid Plagiarism The best way to avoid plagiarism in essay writing is to get into the habit of distinguishing your own work from that by other people. We assume that unreferenced work is your own, so make sure that phrases and sentences that are not your own are in quotation marks and given precise references, and that ideas and arguments that are not your own are properly referenced. In cases of concepts or facts that are widely used or known this may not be necessary - for example "liberals believe in the importance of individual freedom" or "Australia has six states". To avoid accidental plagiarism, ensure that the notes you use to prepare your essay clearly identify quotations and have full references.</p></pre>

Week 4 – Wednesday, 21 August

Lecture: Decolonizing Research and Power Sharing
In this lecture we will consider a set of guiding ideas, thoughts and principles of about bioprospecting, biopiracy and ethics. 

Tutorial Topic: Pros and Cons of Bioprospecting 
This tutorial focuses on the following key themes:
•	What is bioprospecting? When does it become biopiracy (see Gray 1997; Kerr 2010)?
•	What are some of the merits of bioprospecting?
•	What are some of its negative impacts?
•	Why is collaboration between bioprospectors and the governments of countries in which resources are located not always ethically sound?
•	Why do Indigenous peoples responsible for the knowledge bioprospectors require sometimes miss out on the resulting ‘benefits to humanity’? Provide examples…
•	How could bioprospecting result in mutually beneficial outcomes for all parties concerned?

Week 5 – Wednesday, 28 August

Lecture: Traditional Knowledge and Collaborating with Natural Historians

•	Why is it valuable for Western scientists to consider Indigenous knowledge (see Drummond 2009)?
•	Why can Indigenous knowledge sometimes go ‘under the radar’ (see Rusack et  al. 2011; Ayre and MacKensie 2013)?
•	What are some good examples of scientists collaborating with Indigenous people?

Tutorial Topic: Illustration, reflection and how to ‘break out’ of a field journal

In this tutorial, you will observe a species on campus attempt and share a short piece of reflective writing, illustration or performance in small groups. Consider relationships the species you choose has with its ecosystem and people (including you).
1.	Can you challenge the conventions of natural history in this activity?
2.	Can you incorporate Indigenous ways of communicating understandings of the environment?
3.	What sort of innovative practices could enhance some of the research outlined in readings from this week?
4.	What does truly cross-cultural and collaborative research look like? What does in need? Is it possible? What difficulties are involved?

Week 9 – Wednesday 25 September - NO CLASS

Compulsory Albany Field Trip Monday 30 September to Thursday 3 October (DURING STUDY BREAK) 

FIELD TRIP
ALL students are required to participate in an interactive field trip to the Albany region in the mid-semester break. Camp details to be advised. 
(<a href='https://www.dsr.wa.gov.au/camps/locations/quaranup' target='_blank'>https://www.dsr.wa.gov.au/camps/locations/quaranup</a>).

INDG2700 Knowing Country: The Dreaming and Darwin field trip to Albany will incur an approved fee to be confirmed. This fee covers all costs, including Elders’ fees, transport, accommodation and meals at the Albany campsite. Lunches on the travel days (Monday and Thursday) are not covered. Payment may be made by credit card at: <a href='https://payments.uwa.edu.au/INDG2700AlbanyFieldTrip' target='_blank'>https://payments.uwa.edu.au/INDG2700AlbanyFieldTrip</a>
Please contact the School of Indigenous Studies if you experience any difficulties making this payment.
The bus will leave the UWA Crawley Campus bus bay (near the tennis courts) at 9.00 am sharp on Monday 30 September and arrive back at Crawley by 5.00 pm on Thursday 3 October. Please arrive at 8:30 am on Monday to allow departure on time. Please don’t be late or you will miss this essential component of the course.
Students will rotate through a selection of the following sites and activities – updates to be advised:
Fish Traps: 
With local Noongar custodians and an expert on estuaries, students will hear these collaborative perspectives on the ancient fish traps at Oyster Harbour, then survey the area – attempting to draw on both perspectives in field observations.

Frenchman’s Bay / Gap:
If the fish traps are not visible at high tide, students will visit Frenchman’s Bay and The Gap instead. Similarly, with local Noongar custodians and an expert on estuaries associated with coastal areas students will draw on both perspectives in field observations.

Again, with local Noongar custodians and a Natural Science Expert, a tour of significant ecological sites around the Albany area with a botanist.  Students should attempt to consider and incorporate both perspectives presented when recording field observations.

Town tour:
Students will begin at an elevated location to view the Albany region, then walk down past a Noongar geological site and the statue of a significant figure, until finally reaching the Albany Residency Museum. Students should use this opportunity to question faculty and add geographical, historical and cultural context to their field observations. 
Stirling Ranges (time permitting):
Students will travel north to the Stirling Ranges, and hear how they are highly significant to many Noongar peoples from local Noongar custodians. If time and weather permit, students will participate in a cultural tour and learn about Noongar plant foods from custodians, providing further opportunity to learn about Indigenous natural history. 

What to bring:
The Albany region is famous for rain and cold weather, which can still be experienced in September. Students should bring rain gear and walking shoes. Requirements for the field journal are listed below. Essential items to bring for camp include a sleeping bag and pillow. A full list of what to bring will be advised via LMS and during the course closer to the dates of the field trip.

In camp:
Experiences will range from Welcome to Country, Story sessions with Noongar custodians and instructions on constructing Field Journals.  Opportunities to undertake group and individual work on the Field Journal Assignment will occur over the camp week.

Further details will be provided on the Unit LMS and in lectures closer to the dates of the field trip.

ASSESMENT BRIEFS

Assignment 1 – Take Home Examination 20% 	
Students are required to complete an examination consisting of 10 questions each worth 2%, and students are expected to answer all questions. 
Deadline and Submission Details:
The take-home examination will be posted on the LMS on Monday 19 August 2019, and will have to be completed and submitted via the LMS by 5.00pm Monday 26 August 2019.  The examination will be based on all the lecture, reading and tutorial material covered in weeks 1-5.

Assignment 2 – Field journal – 40%

The Field Journal is due to be submitted by 5.00pm Friday 11 October 2019 and the journal has a 2,500 words (min) – 3,000 words (max). It is due to be submitted via the front desk at School of Indigenous Studies with a coversheet with student name, student number and return address. [note the Rubric will be used for the basis of the assessment].

Equipment: 
Your blank field journal will be provided on the field trip. You will need to bring, pens and pencils (graphite and coloured), eraser, sticky tape, and camera or smartphone.

Activity: 
Part of your responsibility in this unit will be keeping a field journal. This field journal forms a major part of your assessment (40%) and is tied to everything you do while on the field trip. The study of plants and animals in their natural environment requires observations on their behaviour, life history traits, distribution, abundance, habitat and landscapes. The naturalist usually makes a record of these observations in a field journal. Most field journals consist of three major components – you are expected to complete the first two:

i.	a ‘journal’ which is a narrative diary of daily observations, and includes locality information, weather conditions and species lists.
ii.	‘species accounts’ which are running notes on individual observations of selected species, and
iii.	a ‘catalogue’ which is a systematic (and numbered) list of all collections made. You will be required to produce a field journal including the first two of these components, a narrative diary of daily observations, and species accounts. We will not be making collections during our field trip.

Your field journal can contain sketches, photographs, diagrams, charts, stories – any device used to ‘capture’ knowledge of something in the environment. It should also contain descriptive explanations of what you have captured and include reflective writing, which deals with the relationship between yourself (as the observer) and the subjects. A field journal is not a diary, so avoid writing about what you had for breakfast, or other trivial information. 
Write daily accounts consecutively. It is common practice to rule a margin about 2.5cm wide down the left hand side of the page, and to write the date in this margin where each new daily account begins (Fig. 1).  Underline the date and locality.
Write up your observations as soon as possible. You will find it hard to write a neat copy in field conditions, so take copious field notes and write them up in camp each evening. You may wish to write quick field notes in one section of your notebook and neat daily and species accounts in another.
Tips:
It may help to think of journal writing as creating a resource for future use. Your future self, or another person, should be able to use it to help interpret a place, story or living thing – whether that future visit is in 1 year, 10 years or 100 years from now. 
We will be generally unable to go back to the places where you made your field observations, so it is even more important to make a legible and complete record as soon as possible. 
The journal records your observations, first impressions and ideas. It should be capable of supporting detailed analysis for the essay.
Narrative diary of daily observations:
A good starting point is to include a description of the landscape and vegetation types at each locality, making sure you make a note of dominant and important plant and animal species. Make use of sketches, photographs and stories to do this. Develop a hypothesis that attempts to explain the patterns you have observed. Record a list of all the plants and animals seen each day at each location, giving an indication of the time of sighting. Annotate the species lists with additional information such as how many individuals you observed, whether you took a photograph, and so on. Other things you might like to record are the weather and a description of the locality.

Cultural knowledge:
You will hear stories, observations and accounts from Indigenous people guiding us on the fieldtrip. People may relate stories of their connections to a place or their family history.  At first, some of this information may not seem to be related to Indigenous perceptions of nature. However, remember a person’s connections are important to how they perceive a place, plant or animal. Personal or family history may also influence a person’s perceptions. Try to relate what you observe to what you learn from Indigenous guides and advisors, whether or not it is a direct comment on the natural world.

Species accounts:
One suggested approach would be to focus on a selected species of plant or animal which you encounter during your time at the camp, or which you may want to write about in your essay assignment, then start to make observations, test hypotheses and explain the significance of that species in its ecosystem/environment/storied landscape. Each species covered should have one or more pages to itself (Fig. 2). The species account is where you would write down a detailed description of the species and your observations of behavior, ecology, phenology (e.g. flowering times), morphology, reproduction, and so on. You may also want to include the results of measurements and surveys. Drawings, maps and diagrams would also be appropriate.

Submission Requirements:
You will be required to share your draft journal with peers and faculty for formative feedback before leaving the field trip and will subsequently submit the completed journal to the School of Indigenous Studies, Shenton House or the UWA Albany Centre (Albany students only) with a signed cover sheet before 5.00pm, Friday 4 October 2019.

Assignment 3 – Major Essay 2,500 words (min) – 3,000 words (max) – 40%
Essay is due to be submitted by 5.00pm Monday 28 October 2019 at 5pm on LMS

Investigate and discuss the range of contrasting and cohesive perspectives (Indigenous and non-Indigenous) on a chosen species, group of species, or environmental feature of the southwest of WA. In your essay, address the questions below – your writing may combine these issues.
•	How do local Aboriginal people name, ‘see’ and understand the thing you are investigating?
•	How do natural historians name, ‘see’ and understand it?
•	How has learning two perspectives helped your understanding? 
•	Is it possible to integrate these perspectives to gain better understanding? Why/why not? What are the advantages? Wat are the challenges?

In your essay incorporate a range of external citations (Indigenous writers, scientific papers etc. – these may be from the unit readings).
Reference the observations made in your field journal. You may also include diagrams, sketches, artwork etc.
Use UWA Oxford referencing style with footnotes.
You may not select Nuytsia floribunda as this species is already covered in the readings.
Please consult the Essay Writing Advice on page 33 of this unit outline for details on:

•	Appropriate use of language

•	The UWA Oxford style guide <a href='https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/Oxford' target='_blank'>https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/Oxford</a>
OR
•	The UWA Harvard style guide <a href='https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/harvard' target='_blank'>https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/harvard</a>
Brief:
The major essay is your largest piece of assessment and requires you to critically examine an aspect of Indigenous knowledge.  Students will be expected to critically analyze primary and secondary sources that relate to the topic. Essays should include a thesis or argument, rather than be purely descriptive. The thesis should be clearly stated in the introduction and abstract, be developed throughout the body of the essay and demonstrated in the conclusion.  Assessment rubric is included below.  For example, to provide ‘highly distinctive work’ students need to write an essay that evidences the following:
‘Excellent abstract and introduction, the scope, aims, thesis or organisational theme/s of the essay fully and coherently explained. Question thoroughly introduced and backgrounded in terms of existing research critique. Key terms and definitions thoroughly discussed and referenced.  Extensive, relevant and current reading.  All aspects of the question are addressed in depth.  Detailed and insightful analysis of the issues with very strong readership and command of the field.  Highly original work. Very well written, logically structured.  Clear, plausible, relevant and strong conclusions drawn. All sources appropriately acknowledged using the correct referencing style. Free of spelling and grammatical errors with exemplary attention to technical detail, submission and presentation formats.’

Referencing Style:
•	Oxford at: <a href='https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/Oxford' target='_blank'>https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/Oxford</a>
OR
•	Harvard at: <a href='https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/harvard' target='_blank'>https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/harvard</a>

This Unit Outline uses Harvard Style. 
You may use either Harvard Style or Oxford style for your references in the essay, but not both.

Format:
Essay body text should be 12 point and be in in Arial font in a Word document. Lines need to be one and one-half spaced and lengthy quotations need to be indented and single spacing (without quotation marks). A margin of 4 cm on the right hand side for markers comments and 2 cm for all other sides is required.

A GUIDE TO APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE AND TERMINOLOGY:
 
It is important to be sensitive to the use of appropriate language and terminology when referring to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This guide is to inform you on preferred terminology for the School of Indigenous Studies, so you can become more confident in your choices about what terms to use. However, it is not definitive and cannot cover all contexts, so as a general rule, if in doubt, ASK first!
 
Collective and Inclusive Terms
‘Indigenous people(s)’ and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people(s)’ are terms commonly used to collectively refer to Australia’s first peoples. 
‘Indigenous peoples’ is a term most frequently used in an international context, particularly in relation to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) and The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples www.social.un.org/index/IndigenousPeoples.aspx
For more information see:  Indigenous Peoples Indigenous Voices Fact Sheet: Who Are Indigenous Peoples?  www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf
 
Some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people object to using the term ‘Indigenous’ because it fails to respect their own identity and preferences and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ is the preferred term.  However, both terms ‘Indigenous people(s)’ and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people(s)’ are acceptable to use in the course. Use capital letters for ‘Indigenous’ and ‘Aboriginal’ when you are referring specifically to Aboriginal peoples in Australia.
In many areas, the term ‘Aboriginal people’ is increasingly used in preference to ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’.  In Western Australia there has been a clear and stated community preference for use of the term ‘Aboriginal people’ as the inclusive term rather than ‘Indigenous’ or ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’.
 
This is demonstrated by the following examples from two key government agencies: 
•             In 2013, Western Australia’s Department of Indigenous Affairs replaced the term ‘Indigenous’ in its title with ‘Aboriginal’, its stated reason being that: "The Department of Aboriginal Affairs (formerly Indigenous Affairs) has been renamed to more accurately reflect the identity of Aboriginal people in Western Australia. This change is in line with requests from the State's Aboriginal community." <a href='http://www.daa.wa.gov.au/' target='_blank'>http://www.daa.wa.gov.au/</a>
•             The Department of Health (WA) stated rationale on using the term ‘Aboriginal’ is that: "Within Western Australia, the term Aboriginal is used in preference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, in recognition that Aboriginal people are the original inhabitants of Western Australia. No disrespect is intended to our Torres Strait Islander colleagues and community”. <a href='http://www.aboriginal.health.wa.gov.au/home/' target='_blank'>http://www.aboriginal.health.wa.gov.au/home/</a>
‘Aboriginal people(s)’ is also appropriate to use in the course.
 
Diverse Communities
‘Aboriginal’ and ‘Indigenous’ are both terms imposed after colonisation, which don’t reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of the more than 250 Aboriginal language groups across Australia as well as the diversity within each of these groups.
Aboriginal peoples prefer to identify themselves in their own language terms e.g. Noongar, Palyku, Yamatji.  Students should be sensitive to this use, but care should be taken to have an appropriate Aboriginal reference point when using these terms. It can be confusing as spellings may have changed over time or may merely reflect regional or individual preferences. For example, UWA uses ‘Noongar’ as per the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council <a href='http://www.noongar.org.au' target='_blank'>http://www.noongar.org.au</a>
 
Language and Terminology to Avoid
The term ‘Aborigine(s)’ is often regarded as having negative connotations and is now regarded as less appropriate, out-dated or even offensive, so use ‘Aboriginal people’ instead.
Generally avoid abbreviations, as they are like to be offensive.
•             There is no acceptable abbreviation for ‘Aboriginal’.
•             Do not use ATSI as an abbreviation of ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’ in written or oral communication.  Exceptions to this are in the context of a recognised acronym for an organisation e.g. ‘AIATSIS’ is the acronym for the ‘Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies’.
Avoid using anthropological terms such as clans, tribes. Aboriginal people do not generally use these terms in Western Australia you can refer instead to ‘Aboriginal communities’ or ‘Aboriginal language groups’.
‘Aboriginal’ and ‘non-Aboriginal’ people should be used in preference to ‘black’ and ‘white’ people etc. 
While Aboriginal people may use terms/language to refer to themselves, such as ‘blackfellas’, this does not imply permission for other people to use such terms.

                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research".
