Students will need to have completed the Essential Readings before departure, these will also be used to post comments on the pre-departure Bali Story Blogs.  This work will be central to the preliminary class meetings and the undertaking of both assessment projects before, during and after the trip.  From these essential readings, students will need to will need to be conversant with the noted Balinese traditional philosophies, spiritualism and beliefs.  The Tri Hita Karana traditional Indigenous Balinese philosophy, for example, relates to the “three causes of well-being” or "three reasons for prosperity" (Fox, 2011)

Pawongan - Harmony among people
Palemahan - Harmony with nature or environment
Parhyangan - Harmony with God [Spiritual Guide]

The Tri Hita Karana is both practiced and expressed in many aspects of Balinese life, both sacred and profane, including daily rituals, communal governance and cooperation (gotong-royong), and within the spatial organization of village land use, family compound and traditional architectures.  This tri partite division of the universe extends with the concept of Tri Angga, which considers the natural world to consist of 3 parts: nista (low or below, sea, evil spirits, impure, profane, hell and the dead), madya (mundane world between sea & mountain) and utama (high or above, the gods, the mountain top, the pure & sacred, heaven & the ancestors) (Davison & Granquist, 1999).

The Tri Hita Karana, and its subjects, have defined our travel itinerary for 2018, encompassing the living virtues of:

•	Responsibility;
•	Sensitivity to self and others (translates as compassion and forgiveness); and 
•	Gratefulness. (Chantal Monte -  <a href='http://www.edgemagazine.net/2011/02/tri-hita-karana/' target='_blank'>http://www.edgemagazine.net/2011/02/tri-hita-karana/</a>)

A second principle to the ‘knowing, being & doing’ of the Tri Harta Karana is understanding the intra-disciplinary challenges of cultural sustainability where culture is positioned as sustainable development.

ASSESSMENT PROJECTS DETAILS:

ASSESSMENT PROJECT 1: The Bali-Story-Blogs - Participation and Critical Unit Engagement - 40% of the unit assessment. 
This assessment exercise is basically a collection of a minimum of Eight (8) Story-Blogs entered on the Unit’s LMS site that demonstrates both an individual and collective discourse around the content of the study program. There is an optional extra 'Blast off blog (see further below). Each Story-Blog should be illustrated with embedded referenced images that support your Story.  

Important aspect of blogs and assessment: You will also need to comment and provide constructive feedback on everyone’s Blogs. This Project will also include group work to encourage further engagement in the travelling program.

(A)	Countdown Story-Blogs – you need to individually submit at least four (4) Story Blogs to the Unit’s LMS Blog site before departure.  There are instructions on LMS on how the Blogs work.

The First Countdown Story-Blog should provide:

A critical reflection on the Essential Reading – Lilly Brown (2010). Nurturing Relationships Within a Space Created by Indigenous Ways of Knowing: A Case Study. The Australian Journal of Indigenous Education, Volume 39, Supplement, 15-22.  Some questions to think about & answer:

•	What are the key messages in Brown’s article? 
•	How do you think you might be able to participate in these learning relationships?
•	What challenges are there for university students to learn on-country?

The Second Countdown Story-Blog should provide:

•	An introduction of yourself – Who are you?  Where is your family from?  Where’s your Country?  What are you doing at UWA?  Why are you doing this Unit, and what do you want to achieve from this Study Abroad Program in Bali?  Copy & use the Horton Map to locate where your family & country are from. See: <a href='http://www.abc.net.au/indigenous/map/' target='_blank'>http://www.abc.net.au/indigenous/map/</a>
•	Note – you will need to put this second Story-Blog information on a thumb-drive (e.g. say in a PowerPoint presentation file) and bring it with you for the Welcome Session on Day 1 of our travels.

The Third Countdown Story-Blog should provide:

A critical reflection on what you make of the Tri Hita Karana traditional Indigenous Balinese philosophy.  Refer readings noted below.  Compare it to your own Indigenous philosophies or world-views. This Blog could work well with the preparing of your Blast-Off Stories – see below.

The Fourth Countdown Story-Blog:
Your choice!   
Select a further Essential Reading and critique it from your researched understandings of the topic. Again, this Blog could work well with the preparing of your Blast-Off Stories – see below – choose wisely.

(B)	Blast-Off-Stories blog– optional. Describe your feelings and expectations as you take off to Bali, Indonesia. This is an optional extra blog.


(C)	Landing Story-Blogs – this happens when you get back to Australia.  You will need to post another four (4) Bali- Story-Blogs after your return.  These four are critical, as they will allow you to reflect on your study program as a whole, and allow you extra time for further research on specific topics of interest covered over the course of the Program. While we are away, you may want to interview some of the people we get to work with and submit these sound and or video files up onto LMS.  You have more than a week after our return to complete these Landing Story-Blogs on LMS – due by Friday 11th October, 2019.

ADVICE: Please note, to assist writing your Landing Story Blogs- Use your Visual Diary (see below) to critically reflect and document your learning and associated Stories whilst travelling in Bali.  This can inform your Project 2 items as well. 
You will need to find your ‘voice’ during the trip and actively participate and engage in the cultural discussions. It is not a holiday. Remember, this class is about ‘two-ways’ learning where our Balinese hosts and presenters are expecting some reciprocal knowledge exchange. Come prepared; listen deeply, and develop ways to interact and share both personal and scholarly experiences. As we learn in life, the scholarly curiosity of lived-difference is a beautiful thing. Somethings that are worthwhile; somethings that attract a certain care and a soft sense of ‘looking-after’. For time will tell, that these peculiar moments & their associated inquisition are the most generative of any cultural learning experiences.

*	Listen to Ibuh Sari’s stories from the Women’s Centre very carefully. What are their challenges in a paternalistic & class-driven Balinese society? How is she trying to change the lives of women in Bali?
*	Spend quality time with our daily host Sumara to find out why his Kintamani Village is so special. How is this village developing sustainable tourism models for the genuine & long-lasting maintenance of the Tri Hita Karana?

NOTE: all of your Story-Blog research and documentation will need to be included in your Visual Diary (print all blogs from LMS and any other documentation you have and paste or staple these at the end your Visual Diary)

ASSESSMENT PROJECT 2:  The Visual Diary- Major Project – 60% of the unit assessment. 
Firstly, buy a really good A4 size sketchbook before you take-off, plus a little note-book for daily use.  In true Balinese style, the Visual Diary will need to capture all your unit’s work – from ‘go to whoa’ – including community lecture or presentation notes and accompanying study commentary throughout the whole trip.  Think about the equipment and condiments that you might need to take to help make it a creative exercise – e.g. pens n pencils, paints n brushes, tape, scissors, needle and thread, etc.  It will become extremely important to you over the study program and later on in life as a reference to these hopeful invaluable learning experiences. 

So the Visual Diary becomes a critical collection of words and images, sketches and reflective thoughts.  You will need to be disciplined, and ensure you keep on top of this exercise throughout the trip.  It should have a daily account of your study program and those other moments of cultural immersion and personal or collective experience.  Be critical though, and meaningfully reflect on each day’s achievements.  Consider, for example, how the Tri Hita Karana is experienced in your daily life of Bali.  Draw, record and photo these experiences from a scholarly point-of-view.  All copied images, including photographs need to referenced with sources acknowledged. 

We will be having Visual diary presentations during the trip so you will need to be on top of it. 

You will also have ample time after you get home to expand on your learning experiences and to extensively reflect and document these findings with further research.  Finally, in the concluding pages of your Visual Diary you will need to answer the following question: 

What has the trip meant to you as an Indigenous person – an Indigenous scholar ? 

Refer notes on the  visual-diary entries at the end of this guide. Visual examples will be up on LMS.

Rubrics are located in LMS.

All final project submissions are due on or before 4pm, FRIDAY 1 November 2019.

Preliminary Itinerary: On LMS and handout at first class meeting

LOCATION 1: Central Bali - Ubud 
Ubud is a thriving village in central Bali and is considered the cultural capital of this tiny island. It is famous as an arts and crafts hub, and much of the village and nearby areas consist of artists’ workshops and galleries. Here you find remarkable architecture and other sites—historical museums, famous woodcarvers and artists, and an array of interesting cafes, local foods, and non-stop ceremonies. The word Ubud comes from the Balinese word for medicine, so it is here that people flock for healing energies, good spirits, meditation, yoga, artistry, and Indigenous knowledge. 

Days 1-5
•	Welcomes & Cultural Inductions
•	Spend the late afternoon with elder Agung Rai, founder of the iconic Balinese art museum (ARMA) as he shows you remnants of Bali’s ancient history hidden under Ubud’s more modern façade
•	Wake up laughing as you experience firsthand the health benefits of laughing yoga
•	Learn Balinese music and dance, woodcarving and offering-making at a local banjar  
•	Visit the Taman 65 Office – a human rights activist group founded by the children of two Balinese communists who were executed in 1965 – an often unknown piece of history that implicates international governments as silent supporters in a massacre of approximately 80,000 Balinese, and 500,000 Indonesians;
•	Have dinner at a Balinese women’s center and learn about their job skills and healthy living programs 
•	Attend a private dinner and dance performance at the Peliatan Palace. Over dinner, you’ll have the opportunity to ask the Prince questions about Bali’s traditional culture as well as modern-day challenges 
•	Visit a traditional market and temple, & walk through historic rice paddies with our traditional herbalist & medicine to study ethno-botany and its impacts on sustainable agri-cultural practices.

LOCATION 2 – Kintamani 

Days 6-7  
Our host Samara will take us to his home village, with a boat ride to visit Trunyan Village on Lake Batur, at the foot of Mt. Abang. An optional guided hike up Mt Batur to watch the sunrise . Note – ‘The Trunyanese are often referred to as Bali Aga (mountain Balinese), which refers to a conservative, pre-Hindu way of life with ancient, neolithic customs and a very definite avoidance of outside influences. Instead of the term “Bali Aga, the term Bali Mula (‘original Balinese’) is often used instead. In this respect it should be noted that the Bali Aga are in no sense ‘original’. Therefore the term ‘Mountain Balinese’ is, from a historical perspective, more correct. The Bali Aga namely have always occupied their ancestral villages from choice and performed their traditional crafts and trades appropriate to the nature of the land.” See: <a href='https://www.wonderfulbali.com/trunyan-traditional-bali-village/' target='_blank'>https://www.wonderfulbali.com/trunyan-traditional-bali-village/</a>  

Location 3: Northwest Bali - Pemuteran  
Pemuteran is a small fishing village on the northern coast of West Bali.  This is a small laid-back village, which has become increasingly popular with visitors in recent years.  There are a number of waterfront resorts and its proximity to Singaraja and the West Bali National Park together with the extreme natural beauty of the area, has fuelled quite rapid growth in tourism infrastructure in the area.  Pemuteran is also home to the largest artificial Biorock reef project in the world and there is a real spirit of marine conservation effort in this area (Coral Restoration Project)

Days 8-9

•	Visit an award-winning coral restoration project and snorkel over the coral structures
•	Spend an afternoon with a local Balian and learn about the healing powers of this mystical traditional practice
•	Stretch with a morning hike in West Bali National Park
•	Enjoy a picnic lunch at Gilimanuk Bay


LOCATION 4: West Bali - Mengwi   
Mengwi is located in the western part of Bali and is famous for its rolling green landscapes, clove and coffee plantations and spectacular rice paddies. The village of Mengwi has a long and rich history associated with its Royal family, one of Bali’s main ancient kingdoms, and is nestled in shady coconut groves, surrounded by rice fields and rivers.   

Day 10
Meet community leader Agung Prana and learn about his community-based tourism philosophy for Bali Observe traditional Balinese life during a cultural visit and walk through Puri Taman Sari Village area;

Departure and Return to Perth: Denpasar Airport

Please note that the Bali Institute for Global Renewal, in association with their partnering Indigenous communities, has organized this travel itinerary.  SIS is indebted to these significant contributions to our ongoing Indigenous study abroad programs, and in particular to the fantastic support and work by Marcia Jaffe, Prita Febrina, Ryan Feinstein and Nina F. Reed. 

Note also that the itinerary is subject to change.  We need to flexible as we travel & visit our Balinese colleagues. Students are required to participate from Perth airport back to Perth airport.
