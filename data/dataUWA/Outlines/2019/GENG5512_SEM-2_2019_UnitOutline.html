Students can commence the unit in either semester 1 or semester 2. The academic objectives of the project are to improve students’ understanding of the research process and to develop their capability to conduct independent research. Students learn about recent advances and gain in-depth technical competence in at least one specialist area of their discipline, apply the basic elements of research design to investigate a theory or hypothesis, and appreciate how research skills support lifelong learning. Students are required to communicate their findings to technical and non-technical audiences using a range of media. They are also exposed to the University’s research culture and opportunities to pursue further study. Students may choose a project from a list of advertised topics, negotiate a topic with an academic supervisor, or apply for an industry Co-operative Education for Enterprise Development (CEED) project.</td>

                    <p>GENG5512 - Engineering Research Project Part 2 - SEM-2-2019 - 2019 - Face to face / Blended learning</p>
                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>This unit is taken over two successive semesters and parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. Students can commence the unit in either semester 1 or semester 2. The academic objectives of the project are to improve students’ understanding of the research process and to develop their capability to conduct independent research. Students learn about recent advances and gain in-depth technical competence in at least one specialist area of their discipline, apply the basic elements of research design to investigate a theory or hypothesis, and appreciate how research skills support lifelong learning. Students are required to communicate their findings to technical and non-technical audiences using a range of media. They are also exposed to the University’s research culture and opportunities to pursue further study. Students may choose a project from a list of advertised topics, negotiate a topic with an academic supervisor, or apply for an industry Co-operative Education for Enterprise Development (CEED) project.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Lecture Capture System</h3>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>The process of completing a project and delivering a final report is an essential element of students' professional preparation for their career. The student is responsible for planning and executing the project, and is expected to take the initiative in all project matters. The academic supervisor is expected to provide guidance to the students. Different supervisors will have different approaches; some supervisors will require regular meetings, others may expect students to make appointments as their needs dictate.</p></pre></p>

The seminar or conference presentation allows you to communicate your work, findings, and their importance, to a group of peers in your discipline. Further information on the timing and format of your seminar or conference presentation will be provided by the Coordinator for your specialisation.   Prior to the seminar you will be required to provide an extended abstract outlining what your seminar will be on. The extended abstract should concisely outline the essence of your work. It is a ‘structured’ document that should cover similar elements to your proposal and final report - a brief context, what has been done previously, the problem you are seeking to solve, and the progress or outcomes (depending how far through the project you are).

The abstract should be approximately one page in length and provided digitally. It will be used by the Coordinator to advertise your seminar or presentation.&nbsp;</p><p>Final Report (50%)

The final paper or report, sometimes referred to as the “dissertation”, represents the culmination of your work. It will be written as a report fulfilling the requirements of technical/design reports traditionally used in the discipline.

The main body of your paper or report should be between 6000 and 8000 words, excluding figures and appendices.The assessment will consider the depth of research presented in the paper. The word count must be included below the title and author at the front of the document.

The paper/report must be submitted digitally for archiving in two files: a source file (eg. Latex or Word, in which the word count can be verified) and a PDF file.&nbsp;</p><p>Professional Conduct (10%, assessed throughout the project)

Like research that you many do in the future, and perhaps more than any other coursework unit, success in the Engineering Research Project relies on your proactivity, initiative and judgement.

The professional conduct component is a participatory mark that considers aspects such as preparation and participation at meetings with supervisor/s, initiative, critical self-review, ethical and professional behaviour.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
