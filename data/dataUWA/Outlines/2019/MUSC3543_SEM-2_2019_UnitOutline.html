It emphasises the understanding and development of individual leadership skills in both conducted and un-conducted musical ensembles, the collaborative interpretation and communication of musical ideas, and rehearsal techniques for different music ensembles. These skills are developed through the study, preparation and performance of selected chamber music repertoire, and practical workshops in conducting skills. Students engage with various theoretical frameworks, through musical score study, source readings in performance practices and rehearsal techniques. 

This unit is an elective unit in the Music Studies major in the Bachelor of Arts degree.</td>

<ol><li>Individual coaching during Chamber Music sessions, where groups meet weekly to rehearse in the assigned venue.  Conservatorium staff coordinate and rotate through groups according to the needs of the repertoire, experience of each group etc
<li>Chamber Music and New Music Ensemble classes, which provide opportunities for students to develop their practical work/acquire performance experience with input from peers and staff.  Students must attend Chamber Music class and New Music Ensemble as scheduled
<li>Conducting Workshops, where students are tutored and guided through various techniques of conducting, as well as developing skill related to rehearsal leadership
<li>Self-directed study and rehearsal, which enable students to acquire knowledge and skills independently and autonomously, whilst taking responsibility for the quantity and quality of their learning, including private preparation of their part prior to each rehearsal. </li></ol></pre>

The activity/ensemble should be chosen in collaboration with the performance staff, and in some circumstances may involve an audition. Chamber groups can be formed either in collaboration with other students or by having a group assigned by staff. In all cases, repertoire must be approved by staff.

If a student is unable to attend a class or activity due to illness or other emergent personal circumstances , they must notify the unit lecturer/tutor (in writing) at least 24 hours in advance, with a medical certificate or other statutory documentation supporting the absence.  Students with unsatisfactory attendance/participation may not have their work assessed and this will result in the award of a zero mark for the unit. 

<strong>Absences</strong>
Professional musicians are not granted absences for non-genuine reasons, and neither will you be. 

Every absence from rehearsals or performances undermines educational objectives and group experience for all students.  Absences will therefore be determined as either excused (unforeseen and genuine) or unexcused.

<strong>Genuine reasons</strong> for absences will always be granted an exemption.  In such circumstances you should advise your ensemble/class director in advance where possible (e-mail is acceptable) and, if requested, following-up by submitting a formal Special Consideration application with supporting documentation (e.g. a medical certificate) through Student Services.  

<strong>Non-genuine reasons</strong> for absence include:
<ul><li>I slept in
<li>I have a work commitment (this includes "my boss changed my shift")
<li>I have a family event
<li>I have a rehearsal/performance for a non-UWA event
<li>I have a ticket to a concert
<li>I have to complete an assignment for another unit which is due today
<li>I have a lesson. (Note clearly: Do <u>not</u> schedule lessons during large ensemble. You will not be excused.)

<h4><strong>Hearing protection</strong></h4><span>Listening to and performing music at high decibel levels can pose a risk to your hearing health. Cumulative and/or prolonged exposure to moderately high decibel levels, or short exposure to very high decibel levels, can adversely affect and permanently damage your hearing. The maximum average safe level of exposure time and sound level per day for ALL sound exposure including your music activities is 85dB for 8 hours—the level equivalent, for example, to playing or listening to unamplified chamber music at close range. Listening to recorded music at high volume (for example using an iPod with headphones) can contribute significantly to risk levels in combination with exposure to live music practice, rehearsal and performance. Students in Music performance units are advised to take precautions to protect their hearing, including the use of musicians’ earplugs when exposed to high decibel levels. Musicians’ earplugs have been shown to effectively filter excessive noise and thereby reduce the risk of hearing damage and are now widely used and promoted in the music industry.

It is expected that students who will be regularly exposed to high decibel levels in music practice, rehearsal and performance in Conservatorium units and performance activities will take necessary precautions to protect their hearing. The Conservatorium of Music will provide, free of charge, a single pair of generic musicians’ earplugs per student per year to students enrolled in a performance unit. Students can collect their free musicians earplugs from the Conservatorium Office. Students with consistently high levels of exposure may need to contact a professional audiologist for advice concerning earplugs appropriate for their specific needs, to ensure the maximum musical and health benefit.<p style="line-height: 16.5pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;font-family: Arial , sans-serif;color: rgb(51,51,51);">___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ </span></strong>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
