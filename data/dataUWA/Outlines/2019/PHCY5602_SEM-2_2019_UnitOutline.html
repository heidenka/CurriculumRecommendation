Emphasis is placed on students increasing their awareness of the patient as a whole through the concept of patient-centred care. This involves the development of professional ethics, communication and problem-solving skills through tutorials, workshops and reflective activities. To present a clinical perspective, the pharmacology and pharmacotherapy of major disease states are delivered in an integrated fashion. This provides students with a practical understanding of how theoretical knowledge is applied to patients and provides an in-depth look into the pharmacists' role in management of these disease states.

Topics include the autonomic nervous system, pain, cardiology, respiratory medicine and diabetes. Simulated pharmacy practice sessions continue to develop both the integration of knowledge with practice and the students' communication skills.</td>

Emphasis is placed on students increasing their awareness of the patient as a whole through the concept of patient-centred care. This involves the development of professional ethics, communication and problem-solving skills through tutorials, workshops and reflective activities. To present a clinical perspective, the pharmacology and pharmacotherapy of major disease states are delivered in an integrated fashion. This provides students with a practical understanding of how theoretical knowledge is applied to patients and provides an in-depth look into the pharmacists' role in management of these disease states.

Topics include the autonomic nervous system, pain, cardiology, respiratory medicine and diabetes. Simulated pharmacy practice sessions continue to develop both the integration of knowledge with practice and the students' communication skills.</p></pre>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre>
                    <h3>Teaching and Learning Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>This unit comprises of lecture/workshops, tutorials, small group activities, oral presentations, simulated learning sessions, peer assisted learning, mentor groups and reflection. The pharmacology and pharmacotherapy of different disease states will delivered in an integrated fashion. Lecturers will use cases to illustrate their practice area. 
Simulated learning tutorials allow practise of communication skills and integration of clinical knowledge with clinical tutors and peer tutors. Non-contact time during SL tutorials has been time-tabled to provide you with the opportunity to work in small groups and with your mentors. Learning details about some drugs off by heart is unavoidable, however using group time to practise your drug knowledge will greatly assist with retention of this information. Students who effectively work in their small groups report of the benefits of this particularly in the reduction of stress prior to assessments.
Drugflash is an app developed for the UWA MPharm program to help you recall correct drug facts. The drug lists have been organised in trimesters and is available via drugflash.app 
A reflective component is included to develop a means for you to monitor and better understand your knowledge and understanding. Reflection is essential for deeper learning and for self-awareness that is required for professional growth.

Attendance at all sessions is an important learning experience for all students and therefore attendance is expected. In addition, external experts are invited and a full audience is their expectation. All lectures delivered by guest lecturers are compulsory. Students must arrive in time to sign-in prior to the session commencing. All mentor sessions, simulated learning tutorials and case-based workshops are compulsory; with at least 80% attendance rate required. If a student is unable to attend a session they will need to discuss this with the Unit Coordinator. Please note: it is considered professional behaviour to attend all sessions on time. 
If a student is unable to attend a session due to illness or for any other exceptional circumstance, the Unit Coordinator must be contacted as soon as practicable. Absences of more than one day due to illness will require a medical certificate to be presented.  Failure to meet this requirement may/will result in a report of Professional Misconduct being made. 

Name badges are compulsory for all Pharmacy Practice sessions – the tutors and lecturers use a problem based learning style where you need to participate in discussions in class and it is important that the tutor can refer to you by your name.

Preparation
Many sessions will involve preparation beforehand to enhance the learning experience.  Please ensure this preparation is completed.  If for some reason the preparation cannot be completed, discuss this in advance with the Unit Coordinator. Sessional staff will be asked to report back to the Unit Coordinator if preparation is not completed at an acceptable level.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
