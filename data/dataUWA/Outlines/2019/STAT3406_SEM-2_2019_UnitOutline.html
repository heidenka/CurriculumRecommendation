                                    <td>Statistical methods are used to analyse data in a wide variety of fields (e.g. engineering, medicine, agriculture, business, economics, psychology, genetics, criminology, the social sciences). While statistical theory can be helpful in analysing such data, its direct application may be limited by practical problems. For example, some of the data may be missing, some observations may be inconsistent with the rest of the data, the standard assumptions (e.g. normality) may fail, and the standard methods may not answer the important questions. The best way to learn how to deal with these practical problems is to gain experience in analysing real data. This unit provides that experience through case studies and projects. The emphasis is on applying statistical methods to interesting practical problems rather than on the theory behind the methods. 

The unit covers applications of a number of widely used statistical techniques selected from generalised linear models, nonlinear regression models, advanced regression topics, survival analysis, non-parametric statistics, multivariate analysis, and time series analysis.  Furthermore, throughout the unit a large emphasis is placed on data visualisation techniques.</td>

While statistical theory can be helpful in analysing such data, its direct application may be limited by practical problems. For example, some of the data may be missing, some observations may be inconsistent with the rest of the data, and the standard methods may not answer the important questions. The best way to learn how to deal with these practical problems is to gain experience in analysing real data. This unit provides that experience through case studies and projects. The emphasis is on applying statistical methods to interesting practical problems. 

The unit covers applications of a number of widely used statistical techniques selected from generalised linear models, non-linear regression models, advanced regression topics, survival analysis, non-parametric statistics, multivariate analysis, time series analysis, among others. Furthermore, throughout the unit is placed emphasis on data visualisation techniques.</p></pre>

<strong>Assessment - Additional Information</strong>
<u>This unit has several forms of assessment:</u>
* Continuous assessment (20%)
* Mid-term test (30%)
* Final exam (50%)

The Continuous assessment is based on solving exercises related to theoretical and applied details of the content of the unit. The Mid-term test and the Final exam will be done at the Lab. They will be consist of the analysis of one or more data sets, using the methods presented in the lectures.

The questions on the continuous assessment will be similar to the questions that students will find on the mid-term test and final exam. The continuous assessment is to help the student with the learning process and to improve their experience.

The mid-term exam will be on 18/September from 9:00 to 11:00 am, during the lab hour. The university will schedule the final exam.

The topics to be covered this semester in the unit are:

* Regression analysis (linear and non-linear methods)
 * Generalized Linear Models (solving some problems about data that does not have normal distribution)
 * PCA (Principal Component Analysis - dimension reduction)
 * Cluster analysis (grouping data)
 * Survival Analysis (handle with partial missing information on response variable)
 * Logistic regression (scoring procedures)
 * Time series (how to handle with time-dependent data)
 * Bootstrap (resample technique)
 * model selection (how to choose a model)
 * prediction (the aim is not to understand data, but to predict data)

Each method has a particular way to deal with a different type of data. We will discuss how to present (visualize) the data graphically, for each type of data, and the model result, together with each method. The focus of the unit is the proper application of the statistical methods.

                <div id="includedContent02">
                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
