The main epidemiological research designs and related statistical analyses are described and evaluated. Discussion focuses on how health and disease are measured and compared across populations and how researchers measure associations between exposures and health outcomes. Analytical skills are developed using statistical computer software (SPSS) for analysis of research data as well as the critical appraisal of epidemiological studies, which incorporates understanding of the roles of bias, chance and confounding in interpreting study results. The implications of epidemiologic research findings for public policy are also illustrated.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>This unit introduces students to the use of epidemiology and biostatistics as tools in understanding health. The main epidemiological research designs and related statistical analyses are described and evaluated. Discussion focuses on how health and disease are measured and compared across populations and how researchers measure associations between exposures and health outcomes. Analytical skills are developed using statistical computer software (SPSS) for analysis of research data as well as the critical appraisal of epidemiological studies, which incorporates an understanding of the roles of bias, chance and confounding in interpreting study results. The implications of epidemiologic research findings for public policy are also illustrated.</p></pre>
                    <h3>Lecture Capture System</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>In accordance with UWA’s policy on lecture capture all lectures* in enabled venues will be recorded and made available to stream and download by enrolled students via the Lecture Capture System (LCS) for the duration of the unit (including Supplementary and Deferred Examinations period).

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre>
                    <h3>Teaching and Learning Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>In this unit you are encouraged to develop your ability to work both independently and collaboratively. The unit is premised on the adult-education philosophy that each student is an independent and self-motivated learner, with the role of the ‘teacher’ being one of facilitation and direction rather than the source of all knowledge. 
Unit activities are carefully constructed to allow you to learn the principles of epidemiology and biostatistics within particular contexts. The aim is to enhance the acquisition and retention of knowledge by offering you, the student:
•	greater control over your learning;
•	opportunities to develop reasoning  and critical appraisal skills; and
•	the ability to work with others;
You will gain more from this unit if you participate fully by doing the required reading, attending lectures, undertaking the assignment in a timely manner and engaging in tutorials, lectures and computer laboratories in an interactive way. Tutorials/ laboratories for this unit are essential to meeting the learning outcomes.
The learning outcomes are provided to guide your study in this unit. You are expected to refer to these throughout the semester. If any aspects of the learning outcomes are unclear please seek clarification from Jane Heyworth. We encourage you to ask questions and share other useful resources that you have found. It is important that you seek information beyond that provided by the lectures and tutorials. 
If you experience any difficulty with this unit, it is best to discuss this with Jane Heyworth as soon as possible. If you have difficulty generally with your studies or a personal matter, you may wish to contact UWA Student Services, which provides a range of very useful support services for UWA students. These include academic and personal support services, and in particular, Learning Language & Research Skills and counselling. We encourage students to access these freely available services.

                    <h3>Unit Structure</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>This unit comprises four hours of contact each week, held on-campus throughout the semester. It is expected that you prepare for, attend and participate in these classes in order to achieve the learning outcomes.
There are two 45 minute lectures each week. The lecturer will present, describe, illustrate and discuss theoretical concepts of epidemiologic and statistical reasoning and methods. Although it is anticipated that recorded lectures (with screen capture) will be available in Blackboard (see Section 5.1), you are strongly advised to attend lectures in person. Copies of the Biostatistics and Epidemiology lecture content will also be available in Blackboard.
There are six computer workshops and six tutorials during the semester, each are 90 minutes (2x 45 minutes).  Each biostatistics workshop will be held in the computer laboratory room, G127.   Each Epidemiology tute will be held in NCLF G02.
The unit has been structured so that the lectures on a topic are provided in one week and the relevant tutorial/computer workshop on that topic is given in the same week. You are expected to have completed all pre-reading and/or attempted exercises before attending each tutorial. We are happy to answer any questions that arise in doing these pre-readings or exercises, in either the laboratories/tutorials or the relevant discussion board.

For these tutorials, you are expected to have completed all pre-reading and/or attempted the exercises before attending each tutorial, and to actively participate in tutorial/laboratory activities. Your level of preparation and participation will be assigned a mark of 0-3 for each epidemiology tutorial (Please see the marking guide).  
Unless you have been granted an exemption or have special consideration, a mark of zero is given for non-attendance. 
The computer laboratories are not compulsory but we highly recommend you attend these as they will assist your learning.  two staff members will attend these laboratories to clarify any problems you have with the topic question set, and to facilitate the computer-based exercises.  Having two staff there to assist you is an invaluable resource – please make use of them. However, if you prefer you can complete the computer laboratories in your own time.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
