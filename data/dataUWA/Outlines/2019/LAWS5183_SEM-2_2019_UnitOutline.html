                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>This unit examines key concepts in environmental protection law in Western Australia in its national and international contexts. It focuses on the law relating to pollution control and environmental impact assessment. The unit analyses a range of legal techniques and principles applied to environmental protection, including an introduction to the new regulatory challenges of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change.

The unit will be conducted as a recorded lecture and assessable tutorial format. The climate change law theme will be explored through both the lectures and tutorials. The Unit Schedule (below) gives a summary schedule of lectures and tutorials, including the topics covered. We strongly encourage student attendance at the lectures, as this provides the opportunity to ask questions and participate in occasional class discussions. We expect your attendance at the tutorials.  

It will be advisable to do some pre-reading before the lectures. It will be essential to prepare for tutorials. Students must attend the tutorial group to which they have been assigned by CAS unless the Unit Co-ordinator has given prior approval for their attendance in another group. Failure to attend your allocated group means you will lose tutorial participation marks. 

All materials will be delivered electronically, either through LMS or by reference to on-line databases.

                    <h3>Unit Structure</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>The unit is structured in three parts around the three key elements of Environmental Law: 
Part 1 - Environmental Governance: covering Topic 1 on the key definitions, institutions and objectives of Environmental Law;
Part 2 - Environmental Regulation: covering Topic 2 on the policy and information instruments for managing cumulative harm, Topic 3 on the controls on particular activities causing pollution and environmental harm, and Topic 4 on environmental impact assessment; and
Part 3 - Environmental Liabilities: covering Topic 5 on criminal liabilities and Topic 6 on civil liabilities for causing pollution and environmental harm.

The class will be taught by a weekly two hour lecture / seminar, 10am - 12pm on Thursdays and six fortnightly 90 minutes tutorials on Thursday afternoons.  
Please see the Timetable for details of class times and venues.  The tutorial allocations can be found in the Class Allocation System
(<a href='http://www.cas.uwa.edu.au/' target='_blank'>http://www.cas.uwa.edu.au/</a>) (CAS). 
NB Tutorial Group 1 on CAS (meeting from 2pm on 1/8 and fortnightly thereafter) is closed to student registration.  
Tutorial Group 2 (meeting from 2pm on 8/8 and fortnightly thereafter) and Tutorial Group 3 (meeting from 4pm on 1/8 and fortnightly thereafter) are the functioning groups. 

Lectures and Tutorials will commence from week 1 of semester.  These class hours equate to 3 hours per week for students across the semester. The exception to this is that there will be no tutorial meetings for Tutorial 3 (weeks 5 & 6) while students work on the written Tutorial Paper, which is due at the end of week 6.   

Tutorial 1 explores the lawyer's tasks and ethical issues in understanding environmental science, especially climate change science.
Tutorials 2, 3 and 5 will explore the traditional legal principles of Environmental Law and the potential to apply them to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. 
Tutorials 4 and 6 will be based on former exam questions reflecting, respectively: 
- in Tutorial 4, Parts 1 (governance) and 2 (regulation), and 
- in Tutorial 6, Parts 1 (governance) and 3 (liabilities).</p></pre>

Students may enhance their participation by posting comments on the tutorial to the Discussion Board. The Tutor will record attendance and assess participation, including by reading any Discussion Board postings. 

Students must attend the tutorial group to which they have been assigned by CAS unless the Unit Co-ordinator has given prior approval for their attendance in another group. Failure to attend your allocated group without the Unit Coordinator's approval means you will lose tutorial participation marks. 

The assessment of the quality of the contributions to the tutorial discussions will be based on the extent to which a student demonstrates, orally in the tutorials or by Discussion Board postings, that s/he: is well prepared for tutorials; understands the issues and principles raised in tutorial questions; and participates constructively in tutorial discussions by active listening, answering questions, if asked, and volunteering comments, questions or answers in a way that is respectful, timely and develops the discussion - it is the quality rather than the quantity of participation that is most important.

PLEASE NOTE: As tutorial attendance and participation is being assessed, students who are unable to attend a tutorial for medical or other exceptional circumstances should contact the Unit Co-ordinator in a timely manner and provide satisfactory medical or other documentation to explain their absence. If possible, attendance at an alternative tutorial will be arranged. As a matter of courtesy, the student should also inform the Tutor. </p></pre>

Students should be aware that lecture recordings may fail from time to time for technical or other reasons. Where this occurs it may not be possible to rectify the problem and the class will not be repeated or rerecorded.

Students should also be aware that they are not permitted to pass any lecture recordings to any other person by any means. A breach of this obligation constitutes a breach of the University's copyrights and constitutes misconduct in accordance with Statute 17: Student Discipline and the Regulations for student conduct and discipline.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
