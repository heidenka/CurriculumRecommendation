Students undertake a supervised, group-based work, creating a project that will conform to public showcase standards and ultimately become a part of their portfolio. The unit focuses upon the professional development of the critical, creative, collaborative and reflective tools required to excel in the field of media production, equipping students with knowledge of industry standards and applicable skills in project design, planning and management.</p></pre>

                    <h3>Teaching and Learning Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word '><p>In this unit, students are invited to think carefully about the processes of successfully managing a media project in a team-based environment. This includes conceptualising, planning, presenting, completing and reflecting upon the project, alongside developing the creative, collaborative, organisational and technical skills needed to execute a media project. 

Students will do this through a three-part process that involves:

1) developing a pre-production proposal for a Media Project that describes its content and its creative and technical intentions;
2) producing a media project in the form of a short narrative-based film (fiction or non-fiction) that effectively engages contemporary audiences through a theme provided by their tutor;
3) providing a verbal reflection of their learnings to the class in facilitated seminar discussions.

This process directly relates to the assessments, which involve both group and individual tasks. The group assessments will be completed in teams comprising 5-7 members, depending on seminar size.</p></pre>

1) Lectures will provide students with detailed information and examples to understand the step-by-step processes involved in the successful completion of a Media Project including its conceptual, creative, organisational, technical, and communicative elements. Lectures will also address all important information regarding the assessment requirements and criteria. Lecture
Capture System will be used to record introductory lecture content in this unit in addition to visiting lectures.

2) Seminars will act as a practical, hands-on forum where production teams will meet for consultations and liaise closely with their tutor who will inform, support and guide the progress of their work.

3) Workshops will cover advanced camera and sound techniques, camera accessories, advanced post-production techniques, lighting techniques and a recording studio demonstration.

Meetings: students are expected to do further preparation, and regularly meet outside of scheduled classes with team members to work on their projects. </p></pre>

Formative In-class Assessments: There are formative (ungraded) assessments in the unit’s workshops. These include the informal ‘work-in-progress’ presentation of groups’ Pre-production Proposals in Week 5 as well as the facilitated discussions in classes on students’ learnings through the Media Project’s production process. Students’ individual contribution and active participation and contribution in these formative assessments influence their overall attendance and participation mark for the unit.

Teamwork and group assignments
To model the collaborative way that digital media is produced in various creative media industries, a large proportion of the work and assessment in this unit involves working in teams. Teams are required to decide the allocation of their crew roles and responsibilities. Teams are strongly advised to exchange reliable contact information with each other as early as possible, and to maintain continuous contact throughout the semester. Organising yourselves professionally and effectively is the team’s responsibility. If serious teamwork related problems arise, you should contact your tutor immediately, but students should make every effort to communicate with their teams and plan and execute their productions efficiently to avoid difficulties wherever possible.

Copyright
The production, distribution and use of media content are subject to Intellectual Property and Copyright laws. In your Media Project, you are allowed to use audio-visual material created by people other than yourself/your team (this material must be appropriately credited) under the following conditions:
	audio: you can use an unlimited amount of sound, music and sound effects which are in the public domain, or under creative commons licence; or, if you want to use material under copyright you must obtain written permission from the rights holder. All such material must be appropriately credited.
	video/image: you can use a very limited amount of any image or video (a matter of a few seconds on screen; you must consult with your tutor), but you can use this material only if it is in the public domain, or under creative commons licence, or, it is under copyright, but you obtain written permission from the rights holder. All such material must be appropriately credited.

If groups fail to meet these copyright rules, the Media Project can only be used/screened in an educational setting, such as the end of year screening.

COMM3002 Learning Resources
This unit has a collection of online learning resources accessible via the LMS portal and offline resources via the ADL team, including specialised production equipment and editing studios. Learning Resources include:

Readings
There are a number of recommended readings that can benefit not only your work on the Media Project’s theme and technical requirements, but also hone the development of your personal skills repertoire in project-based work and audio-visual media production, your critical thinking about the intricacies of communication practice and its applications in professional contexts, and your capacity to creatively and productively engage with the demands of contemporary media industries. All of these readings can be accessed via the LMS menu.

Technical Videos & Handouts
You are encouraged to make use of the Arts Digital Learning team’s specialised collection of instructional videos and technical handouts on camera, sound and editing equipment and principles, which are located on the ADL page, accessed via the ADL tab on LMS. 

Templates and Links
The unit’s learning materials also include a range of useful templates to assist you with particular elements of your production such as storyboards, script and treatment templates, copyright information sheets and links to a variety of casting resources and royalty free music websites. 

Forms
During your work on the Media Project you will make use of several production management forms such as the location agreement and talent release forms which your group should include in the Pre-production Proposals.

Video production and time management: Successful management of time limits and deadlines are a crucial requirement for professional media production. Groups must be well prepared to shoot their project, as they will only be given time specified in the Unit Timetable to complete the filming. Professional handling of the ADL equipment and their timely return in pristine condition is a responsibility of all students.

Data back-up: Back-up your data to an external hard-drive or cloud; you are responsible for ensuring the back-up and integrity of your projects. </p></pre>

                <div id="includedContent02">
                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
