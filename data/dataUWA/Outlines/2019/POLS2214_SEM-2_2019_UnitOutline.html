                                    <td>This unit focuses on the relationship between strategy, diplomacy and conflict in the international system. The first half of the unit focuses on the nature of geopolitical competition, and the increasingly influential application of geoeconomics. The strategies of the United States and China are the principal focus of attention, and the unit considers the prospects for conflict between these increasingly competitive great powers. The second half of the unit explores a range of new security issues from conflict resolution, human security, as well as energy and environmental security.

This unit builds upon the foundational unit POLS1102 The Contemporary International System. The particular value it adds is to assess the continuing efficacy of classical strategic theory and contemporary human security theory in the context of contemporary conflicts. It provides students with an appreciation of strategy, diplomacy and the causes, conduct and implications of international conflicts in the contemporary international system. Case studies are used to develop links between theory and empirical investigation, allowing students to develop a better understanding of the security dynamics of the contemporary international system from the level of the great powers, to individual human beings.</td>

It is related to, but distinct from the sorts of ‘International Security’ courses which are commonly taught at universities; this unit is more properly thought of as a ‘Strategic Studies’ course. The distinction mainly lies in the fact that it focuses heavily on interactions between states – especially ‘great powers’ – and therefore on national security, as opposed to other ‘non-traditional’ dimensions of security which are typically also recognised today (i.e. environmental-, human-, gender-security, etc.).
The unit begins with theory, both International Relations theory (with a focus on explanations for war/peace) and also strategic theory proper, with explorations of classic works from Clausewitz, Jomini, Hart and others, plus lectures on geo-economics, nuclear strategy and counterinsurgency. We then explore several illustrative historical case studies – Rome, Napoleon and WWII – before, in the second half of the course, we consider contemporary strategic issues. Russian, Indian and Australian grand strategy is examined, and special emphasis is put on exploring the grand strategies of the United States and China, as well as the emerging rivalry between them. The course finishes with brief consideration of the non-traditional dimensions of security to enable you to understand how this course relates to ‘standard’ International Security courses.</p></pre>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre>

By the end of this course you will be able to:
- identify/describe the key theories which have shaped strategic thinking over the ages
- identify how and why states go to war and/or use diplomatic means to pursue their interests
- explain the links between strategic planning, the practice of diplomacy, and the actual conduct of hostilities ‘when diplomacy fails’
- you will also become familiar with several key historical illustrations of ‘strategy, diplomacy and conflict in action’
- and become familiar with the grand strategies of several contemporary great powers (plus Australia, a ‘middle power’); in particular, you will understand the US/China rivalry, and where this might lead 
- understand the relationship between ‘traditional’ strategic studies of the sort which this unit is concerned with, and the more-standard ‘International Security’ units
- participate in lively discussions of geostrategic ideas, issues and events in a rational, constructive and non-discriminatory manner
- appreciate the key issues and actors which shape much of the ‘geostrategic environment’ of the contemporary world

1st half: strategic theory and history - we consider key strategic theorists plus several historical case studies (5 weeks)
2nd half: contemporary strategy - nuclear strategy + counter-insurgency, then grand strategies of Russia, India, US, China (plus potential for conflict between US/China), then Australia (6 weeks)
Final Week - lectures on 'other dimensions of security'

Note: the week starting 30 September is a non-teaching 'study break' - but it is NOT numbered (only academic/teaching weeks are numbered)

‘Broadly speaking’, half of the points are allocated for ‘showing up’ and the rest for participation, but this is not a hard-and-fast rule; for example, if you miss a few tutorials but you are an outstanding participant when present you may still get a very high mark. Use these criteria as a guide:
- Fail (0-49%) – Hardly ever attends, and/or when in attendance says nothing, is obviously distracted by social media on e-devices and/or is actively disruptive, etc.
- Pass mark (50%) – Attends about half the tutorials, but is a ‘passive participant’ (i.e. no evidence of preparation and/or meaningful contribution)
- Credit (60-69%) – Attends over half, some evidence of preparation, participates actively in class discussions occasionally (i.e. can engage with 1 of the discussion questions)
- Distinction (70-79%) – Attends most tutorials, clear evidence of preparation, active participation and contribution to class discussions (i.e. means ‘has obviously done, and understood, the readings’ and can ‘engage with 2 of the discussion questions’).
- High distinction (80%+) – Attends almost all tutorials, high degree of critical engagement, makes original and relevant contributions to discussion (i.e. means ‘has obviously done, and fully understood, the readings’ and can ‘engage with all 3 of the discussion questions’).
Discussion Questions: each week 3 discussion questions are posed (see the Readings below). The tutor will ask these – and related ‘follow-up’ questions – to guide discussion. You should think about these questions while you are doing your readings; note this does not mean you must prepare notes (although doing so might be helpful). The tutors may also ask other questions related to the topic.

Late submission of assignments
A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.
- Extensions: the Unit Coordinator (Alan) and the tutors cannot grant extensions; if poor health or other difficult circumstances mean you need an extension, you must apply through the Student Office (Ground Floor, Social Sciences North Building; entry facing main/central carpark; weekdays 8.30am to 4.30pm; phone – 6488 2091)

Penalty for exceeding word limit
Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.

Referencing
You are not required to use one referencing style, but we do recommend either APA/Harvard in-text or Chicago footnotes. Find a style guide here: <a href='https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/c.php?g=361770&p=2443621' target='_blank'>https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/c.php?g=361770&p=2443621</a>

Academic misconduct
Academic Integrity is defined in the University Policy on Academic Conduct as ‘acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research’. UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.
Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled. Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding academic conduct and ethical scholarship at UWA.

Review and Appeal of Academic Decisions Relating to Students
The full regulations governing appeal are available on the Governance website.

Plagiarism
This is the most common form of academic misconduct (other forms include acting aggressively towards fellow students, or offering tutors inducements in exchange for better marks, etc.). The following is a summary of the Faculty’s policy regarding plagiarism, not a replacement of it. 
First Rule: PLAGIARISM – DON’T DO IT!

What is Plagiarism?   
Plagiarism occurs when someone disguises or misrepresents the authorship of written work and claims it as his or her own, when in fact it has been copied from someone else’s written work. There are two general forms;
1) ‘less serious’ plagiarism involves cutting/pasting from another person’s work into your essay and not indicating such (i.e. by surrounding the quote with quote marks); but then the student does cite the source from which the words came (often at the end of the paragraph; so, not directly after the quote, as should occur). This is still technically plagiarism, and so is punishable, but is less indicative of cheating; rather, it suggests ‘laziness’ and/or ‘misunderstanding’.
2) ‘more serious’ plagiarism involves cutting/pasting from another person’s work into your essay without ever citing the source. This suggests deliberate cheating in the sense of an attempt to ‘pass off’ some else’s work as your own.
- Sometimes students will try to avoid being caught by changing some of the words in the quote; be warned, Turn It In will not be fooled, it will still highlight the section which was cut then pasted into your essay despite the fact not all the words are exactly the same.
- When we find this sort of thing it is more indicative of cheating; it suggests a deliberate attempt to ‘beat the software’.
3) ‘conceptual plagiarism’: this occurs not when you have cut/paste another’s words into your essay, but when you have deliberately ‘stolen their ideas’ and ‘passed them off as your own’. It is more difficult to prove this is the case – after all, you might have arrived at the insight on your own – but you are still strongly advised to not plagiarise in this manner either because a marker is likely to recognise that your ‘original idea’ is actually not very original and penalise you, or they may even suspect you have plagiarised and formally report you.
- Remember: the markers will be much more familiar with ‘the literature’ than you are; they are likely to recognise that the idea or theory (etc.) which you have attempted to pass off as your own was ‘actually first recognised by Prof X decades ago’.

Second Rule: IF IN DOUBT, CITE! (insert quote marks and references when using other author’s words and ideas – play it safe)

Turn It In: When you submit an essay online it will be checked for plagiarism by this software, which searches the entire internet – not just html files but pdf, rich text, word docs in student essay repositories at other universities, etc. – and then generates a report which indicates exactly where plagiarism is to be found in an essay, and where it came from.
Students can generate their own reports prior to handing their essays in to check they haven’t plagiarised; doing so is strongly recommended. A report with something up to 20% or even 25% plagiarism is likely to be OK; this amount usually reflects the citations, the quotes from other authors, the cover page, etc. Anything over 25% will attract scrutiny. Anything over 40% must be automatically reported by the Unit Coordinator.
Third Rule: DON’T TRY TO BEAT TURN IT IN! (this software is extremely effective – you WILL be caught)

If caught, what is the process?
Tutors will consider the similarity report generated by Turn It In. If the tutor suspects plagiarism the Unit Coordinator is advised, and they check too. If the Unit Coordinator believes plagiarism is indicated, the student is reported to a central unit in the School which handles all subsequent stages (assessment, counselling, discipline). The Unit Coordinator’s involvement is strictly limited.

What are the penalties?  
Penalties vary with the seriousness of the offence and are set out in the Faculty’s policy referred to above.  In relatively less serious cases a range of penalties can be applied, including:
- counselling only; handing in another version of the essay; handing in another essay entirely (i.e. a different question), with a pre-determined penalty (perhaps 20%) applied; the paper is graded ‘as if plagiarised sections were absent’ (making the paper ‘disjointed’), etc. 
In the case of work found to contain serious plagiarism, more serious penalties can apply;
- awarded ‘0’ for the assignment and not allowed to hand in another; awarded the grade ‘N-Fail’ for the unit; suspension from the university; expulsion from the university, etc.

Repeat Offenses: 
If the student has a prior record of academic misconduct, more severe penalties will be applied, perhaps even to cases which would otherwise be considered ‘less serious’ offences. All instances of plagiarism and other forms of academic misconduct are entered on a confidential record held centrally at the University, so that graduated penalties can be applied in accordance with the student’s record. The defence ‘but I have done this without penalty in other units’ is unacceptable (like the driver who, when caught speeding, complains that they haven’t been caught before). 

How to avoid it? 
The best way to avoid plagiarism is to get into the habit of distinguishing your own work from that of other people.  We assume that unreferenced work is your own, so make sure that phrases and sentences that are not your own are in quotation marks and given precise citations, and that ideas and arguments that are not your own are properly cited.  In cases of concepts or facts which are widely used or known citation may not be necessary; for example, ‘the sky is (usually) blue’ or ‘Australia has six states’ do not need citations. To avoid accidental plagiarism, ensure that the notes you use to prepare your essay clearly identify quotations and have full references. 
- but don’t over-use quotes – a rough guide is that no more than 10% of an essay should be quoted material – and something closer to a maximum of 5% is ‘best practice’

Final rule: PLAGIARISM – JUST DON’T DO IT!

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
