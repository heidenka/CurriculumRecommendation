Students are asked to critically examine the joint concepts of ‘assembly' and ‘disassembly' and to engage in a hands-on way with the materials and processes used in contemporary design production. During the unit students ‘learn through making' as they design, construct, and document a number of full-scale, working prototypes. They also acquire the skills required to produce professional working drawings, enabling them to communicate their designs with industry.
Design-for-(dis)assembly
As we move further into the twenty-first century, architects and furniture designers face similar trials. The environmental and social implications of design production constitutes an enormous challenge—excessive waste, designed obsolescence, social inequity in production chains, habitat degradation, carbon emissions, resource depletion, and material toxicity are just some of the difficulties with which both disciplines must rapidly come to terms. By engaging with the notion of ‘design-for-disassembly,’ furniture designers have a practical way of ameliorating some of the negative impacts of their design production. The core precept of design-for-disassembly is that each of the components making up a manufactured product should be put together in such a way that they can readily be pulled apart again—the assembled should be easily disassembled. Design-for-disassembly allows different components, made of different materials, to be separately recycled or reused. It is a pragmatic way to prevent things from entering the waste stream unnecessarily Design-for-disassembly also has social and political implications—there is something inherently democratic and liberating in allowing users to repair or recycle a design-object. It expands the possible ways that the items we make and buy can be repurposed.
Unit Ancillary Fee
A small, one-off ancillary fee is levied in this unit. This fee of $70 covers lighting components for project 1, workshop consumables (glue, solder, offcuts, sandpaper, blades, etc.) and materials necessary for directed Workshop Skills Sessions. The ancillary fee does not cover materials required in the production of prototypes; unit participants will generally be required to source these materials themselves and in doing so build relationships with industry and suppliers. The ancillary fee must be paid through the School of Design POS system BEFORE Tuesday of Week 2 so that students can participate in Workshop Skill-Building Session 1. 

Workshop Protocols
This unit is founded on an active and productive relationship with the School of Design workshop. Therefore, there are a number of unit specific workshop protocols (below) with which it is important that you familiarise yourself.

Workshop Skill-Building Sessions:
This unit is structured in such a way as to acknowledge that participants will likely be proficient architectural designers but may not yet be proficient when it comes to furniture design. The first stage therefore, is designed to bring participants up to speed with the skills and knowledge required to ensure that participants will have the capacity to successfully complete assessments. Attendance and participation in Workshop Skill-Building Sessions (Weeks 2-5) will be essential.

Workshop Safety Induction:
Successful completion of this unit requires a valid completion of the workshop safety induction (Part A and B). You will not be able to complete your submissions without workshop access. If your induction requires updating, or if you have not completed an induction it is imperative that this is done before the end of Week 1.

Workshop Priority Access:
The School of Design workshop has been reserved for priority use by this unit on Friday's between 11am and 5pm. Depending on demand, participants may be split into seminar groups with each given a 2 hour priority use time slot during this time.

Material Supplies:
Students are generally required to supply their own materials (including fixings and adhesives). Materials for Workshop Skill-Building Exercises will be supplied by the unit coordinator.
Some large, uncut sheet material or specialty materials not readily available from retail stores may be ordered through the School of Design Workshop. All material must be paid for at time of ordering. Please allow sufficient time for ordered materials to be received and note that delays in receipt of materials are outside the control of School of Design staff and will not constitute grounds for an extension or special consideration. If in doubt, make other arrangements.
Cutting Lists:
You will receive hands-on training in the operation of many or the workshop machines and processes. Students must attend the required workshop inductions and if in doubt about the procedures for the use of any of the machines it is your responsibility to seek assistance and clarification. Workshop staff are there to advise and assist you.
A limited number of the machines (including the panel-saw) are considered too specialised for student use and workshop staff are therefore the only individuals qualified to operate them. If you require materials to be cut on these machines requests must be submitted via a printed cutting
list. Cutting by workshop staff will generally only be done once per week. Students who submit their requests, with all required information, prior to 12 noon-Monday will generally be able to collect their cut items by 4pm-Wednesday. Please note that this will only occur if material has been supplied to the workshop by the time cutting is scheduled to take place. Workshop staff will make every effort to ensure that this process runs smoothly and efficiently; however, at times of high demand there may be delays. Wherever possible these delays will be communicated to any students impacted. Please note, however, that delays in processing cutting lists will not constitute grounds for extension or special consideration. If in doubt, make other arrangements.
Workshop Clean Down:
Workshop areas are expected to be left clean and tidy. There are provisions for students to store work in cupboards and underneath benches throughout the duration of the unit, as long as it is kept neatly arranged and clearly labelled. All work that remains after the completion of the unit will be disposed of.

Moderation of marks
Students should be aware that marks can be adjusted in the period of time between a mark being given for an assessment item and the final mark in the official release of results by Student Administration. Students are referred to Part 1, Section 11.4 of the University Policy on: Assessment under Adjustment of Marks. <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP15%2F5' target='_blank'>http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP15%2F5</a>
Criterion based assessment is designed to provide a measure of students' performance that is directly relevant to the learning outcomes. This approach to assessment provides an indication of the specific knowledge and
skills each student can demonstrate through an assessment task. The use of moderation (as currently defined in the assessment policy) below can and should be used where appropriate.
Moderation is defined in the University Policy on Assessment (the Policy) as “a process to ensure consistent, fair and reliable marking against academic standards” (definitions section). It is “employed to ensure appropriate and consistent marking standards within units, and that assessment outcomes are fair and reliable”.

LMS File Size for Digital Submission
Unless otherwise stated in this unit outline, please note that the maximum file size for digital upload to the Learning Management System (LMS) is 20MB. Files that are incorrect in format or are substantially over this file size limit may not be marked.
Please allow adequate time to upload to LMS, upload time is not grounds for special consideration.

Moderation of marks 
Students should be aware that marks can be adjusted in the period of time between a mark being given for an assessment item and the final mark in the official release of results by Student Administration. Students are referred to Part 1, Section 11.4 of the University Policy on: Assessment under Adjustment of Marks. <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP15%2F5' target='_blank'>http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP15%2F5</a> 
Criterion based assessment is designed to provide a measure of students' performance that is directly relevant to the learning outcomes. This approach to assessment provides an indication of the specific knowledge and skills each student can demonstrate through an assessment task. The use of moderation (as currently defined in the assessment policy below) can and should be used where appropriate. 

Moderation is defined in the University Policy on Assessment (the Policy) as “a process to ensure consistent, fair and reliable marking against academic standards” (definitions section). It is “employed to ensure appropriate and consistent marking standards within units, and that assessment outcomes are fair and reliable”. 

LMS File Size for Digital Submission 
Unless otherwise stated in this unit outline, please note that the maximum file size for digital upload to the Learning Management System (LMS) is 20MB. Files that are incorrect in format or are substantially over this file size limit may not be marked. Please allow adequate time to upload to LMS, upload time is not grounds for special consideration. 


Authenticity of work 
We need to be able to establish the authenticity and authorship of your work, thus the minimum requirement for attendance is defined as no less than half the number of tutorials or studio sessions which are contributing, in process and development, to a submission. 

Submission of Late Work 
Unless otherwise stated, all assessment tasks are due no later than 4pm on the date indicated in the unit's Assessment Items, with the exception of in-class assessment items such as tutorial presentations. Any assessment task which is submitted after the time indicated in the assessment items statement without a formal approved extension will be considered LATE and appropriate penalties will be applied. Information on penalties can be obtained in the Policy on Assessment at <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP15%2F5' target='_blank'>http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP15%2F5</a> 

Extensions 
The Faculty approves extensions only in exceptional circumstances in order to ensure that all students are treated fairly and that submission date schedules, which are designed to produce ordered work patterns for students, are not disrupted. Extensions may be authorised only by the allocated Faculty Course Advising Office or a delegated representative. In all cases, requests for extensions require the submission of Special Consideration form no later than three University working days after the due date. 

Students are encouraged in the strongest possible terms to familiarise themselves with the Policy on Special Consideration available at <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP11%2F23' target='_blank'>http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP11%2F23</a> 

Feedback 
Marked assessments submitted on time will be made available for collection by students at least one week before the next assessment in the unit is due (if it is related to the previous assessment), or no more than 15 University working days after submission, whichever is sooner. 

Building clean-up and folio collection (for units with folio submissions) 
Studios are expected to be left clean and tidy. Drawing boards are to be cleaned. Students must remove all personal property immediately after the submission of their folio. If the content of a folio is used for exhibition then the student must write their name on the back of the work so that when the exhibition is demounted collection is simplified. If staff or the Faculty wish to reserve work for reproduction and/or accreditation purposes then this should be negotiated with individual students. 

Charter of student rights and responsibilities 
The Charter of Student Rights and Responsibilities upholds the fundamental rights of students who undertake their education at the University of Western Australia. The University's charter of Student Rights and Responsibilities is available at <a href='http://www.secretariat.uwa.edu.au/home/policies/charter' target='_blank'>http://www.secretariat.uwa.edu.au/home/policies/charter</a>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
