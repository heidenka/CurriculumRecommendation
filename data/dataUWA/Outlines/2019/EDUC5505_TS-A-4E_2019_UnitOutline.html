It is focused on equipping pre-service teachers to help children achieve learning outcomes associated with the Australian Curriculum – Mathematics.

The unit is delivered as a series of interactive workshops, each focused on a specific pedagogical aspect of mathematics teaching that is well grounded in theories of teaching and learning.  Through participation in these workshops, it is expected that pre-service teachers will learn to recognise, appreciate and model effective teaching strategies and construct their own philosophical and practical understanding of the teaching and learning process.  As well as addressing pedagogical issues, each workshop is designed to help pre-service teachers to become familiar with the mathematical content encountered during middle and upper primary school, and with a variety of teaching resources suitable to teach this content.</p></pre>

ADDITIONAL DETAILED ASSESSMENT INFORMATION:

Assessment 1

This assessment comprises three parts: Workshop presentation; portfolio items for teaching and learning; and professional practice (including workshop and online participation).

(i) Workshop presentation (10%)

The date for your workshop presentation will be negotiated during the first workshop on Monday 22 July. Presentations begin in the workshop Week 2.

Your workshop presentation will provide you with the opportunity to explore a range of activities related to a “Manipulative Focus”, and to make a 10 minute presentation to your colleagues about this manipulative (please plan your presentation so that it is no longer than 10 minutes). Your presentation is an opportunity to practise some teaching skills and to try something innovative.

Your presentation should give a brief overview of the history, development and use of the manipulative, and model an activity illustrating its use in teaching and learning.

At the beginning of the workshop during which you will make your presentation, please submit a brief overview documenting:

●	    what you intend to cover in your presentation;
●	    why you have chosen the particular activity;
●	    what you would expect your colleagues to have understood as a result of the activity;
●	    links to the Australian Curriculum – Mathematics;
●	    other related notes, ideas, and references.

You will be assessed on the following criteria:

●	Planning – A plan containing the elements above.
●	Links made to the ACM, and to the wider literature.
●	Understanding – Intent of the activity is clear to presenter and audience.
●	Application – The activity is engaging and involved classmates fully
●	Effectiveness - The activity challenges your colleagues' thinking and furthers their understanding
●	Resources well-prepared and purposefully utilised.
●	Presentation – Professional and confident;.
●	Creativity

After your presentation, please upload your notes to the appropriate discussion forum on the unit LMS website.

(ii) Portfolio items for teaching and learning (10%)

In this part of the assignment you are asked to collate four (4) of your favourite resources, selected from all of the contributions made to the forums, and comprising one resource from each of:

●	     numeracy;
●	     number and algebra;
●	     measurement and geometry; and
●	     statistics and probability.

For each of these four items, write a paragraph describing why it is a suitable learning and teaching resource or activity. Indicate, if appropriate, how the resource could be improved.

(iii) Professional practice (10%)

Please contribute weekly to the discussion forum for the unit.

You will be assessed on your general professional practice as well as your participation and engagement in workshops, and learning forums.

Assignment 2

You are required to plan a series of four consecutive 45 minute Mathematics lessons that could be implemented in your Semester 2 Professional Practicum Experience. If you are unsure of your class, then plan for a class of 24 mixed ability students in Year 5.

You are to focus on one part of the content strands of the Australian Curriculum – Mathematics, and to develop learning activities that embed the four proficiencies described in the curriculum documents.

Your assignment should:

●	use the elements of a lesson plan as developed in our workshops;
●	begin with a brief statement of your developing approach to teaching and learning in mathematics;
●	include a brief overview or outline describing the focus and intentions of the lesson sequence;
●	include the relevant Outcomes or Content Descriptions (with AC-M code) from Australian Curriculum – Mathematics;
●	identify where and how the Proficiencies are being addressed;
●	identify where and how the General Capabilities of the Australian Curriculum – Mathematics are being addressed;
●	identify areas for differentiation, including learning support for low achieving students and ideas for extension and enrichment;
●	for one nominated lesson only, include a detailed series of lesson steps (including time allocation) indicating the sequence of activities (use a suitable lesson structure, such as Bybee's 5Es with timing 1:3:3:1, or similar);
●	identify the manipulative resources you will use to develop conceptual understanding;
●	include all worksheets, handouts, websites, e-resources, etc., that will be used during the four lessons.

A draft of this assignment is required for the workshop in Week 7, during which formative peer evaluation and feedback will occur, and generic formative feedback will be provided. 

At the beginning of your assignment paper, please include your student chosen assessment criterion and achievement standards, and indicate which of the lesson plans is the more detailed one. 

Assignment 3

Choose a particular manipulative resource (different from the one that you will use in your workshop presentation) and develop a set of 6 x A4 activity cards for independent or group use of the resource.

Write a well-referenced report (approximately 1500 words) providing:

●	an outline of your developing approach to teaching and learning in mathematics (your philosophy for mathematics teaching and learning); 
●	your reasons for choosing this manipulative resource;
●	a discussion of the cultural context and the history of the development, and Mathematical use, of the resource;
●	an evidence-based argument as to why this resource is suitable for use in a Mathematics class and the benefits for student learning;
●	an indication of some possible misconceptions that might be addressed through the use of this resource.

For each activity card indicate:

●	level, or audience suitability;
●	links to Outcomes or Content Descriptions from Australian Curriculum – Mathematics;
●	the Australian Curriculum – Mathematics Proficiencies covered (the set of activities should cover all four Proficiencies);
●	the extent to which the General Capabilities of the Australian Curriculum – Mathematics are being addressed; 
●	an explanation of, and directions for the use, of the tasks or activities;
●	how the activity is differentiated to cater for a range of abilities;
●	assessment (what to look for).

A draft of this assignment is required for the workshop in Week 3, during which formative peer evaluation and feedback will occur, and generic formative feedback will be provided. 

At the beginning of your assignment paper, please include your student chosen assessment criterion and achievement standards.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
