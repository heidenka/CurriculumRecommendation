Students are exposed to the observation and assessment of movement patterns, along with the design and delivery of a developmentally appropriate movement-based program for a child through practical involvement in the Paediatric Exercise Programs based at UWA.</td>

At birth, the brain has almost all its neurons,  about 700 neural connections are being formed every second and the brain reaches 95% of its peak volume by 6 years of age.  Like all structures in the human body, the brain develops, then ages, and neurons begin to deteriorate and connections diminish, with brain volume reducing 5% every decade after 40 years of age.  With such dramatic changes occurring to the brain, combined with all the biological and structural changes occurring elsewhere in the human body; it is not surprising that we see such remarkable changes in human movement.  This unit will explore the changes in human motor behaviour over critical periods of the lifespan, the processes that underlie these changes, and the factors that affect them.

Lectures cover a wide range of topics including prenatal motor development, the transition from reflexes to voluntary control in infancy, development of locomotion, language, intrinsic control and handedness, fundamental movement skills, and the changes occurring during adolescence leading up to what is often considered our 'motor peak'. The lectures then shift to examine the decline in motor function occurring during the latter phases of the lifespan. Students are exposed to the observation and assessment of movement patterns, along with the design and delivery of a developmentally appropriate movement-based program for a child through practical involvement in the Unigym Program based at UWA.</p></pre>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content.

LECTURES: The unit involves 12 lectures; six of which are delivered live and; the remain six can be download weekly from the Lecture capture system.   The lectures cover all the theoretical content of Lifespan motor development.
LABS: The unit involves 7 lab classes; six of which cover the fundamentals of teaching within the Unigym program, including, teaching acquatics, teaching fundamental movements skills, and managing behaviour and motivational teaching. The final lab class students undertake the Mid-Semester multiple choice exam.
PRACS: Within the unit students will complete a 10-week placement in the Unigym program.  The program is run once a week for 1.5hours (60mins land, 30mins acquatic).  Students will deliver an individually tailored program designed to target fundamental movements skills of a child within the Unigym program.    The Unigym program complements the theoretical components of the course, with students having the opportunity to plan and execute an intervention to improve human movement.

The Lectures are delivered both live and online recordings and cover the theoretical content of the unit.  The Labs are delivered weekly in the first 7 weeks of semester, and develop students skills and knowledge to deliver a movement program that focus' on fundamental movement skills.  Students get the opportunity to put their theoretical learnings into practice within the Unigym Program, working one-on-one over a 10 week period as a movement coach of a child, students describe this as a valuable learning experience, especially those who are considering a career in education, coaching, or clinical rehabilitation.</p></pre>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
