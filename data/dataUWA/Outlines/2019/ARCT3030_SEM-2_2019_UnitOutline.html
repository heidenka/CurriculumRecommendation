                                    <td>This unit is the culmination of the technology sequence in the Architecture major. As such, it is thought of as an extension and further development of ARCT2030 Materials and Small Constructions. Through a similarly analytical methodology it introduces students to construction techniques of greater complexity, with an emphasis on architecture as an integrated manifestation of structure, body, skin and building services. 

Topics include architectural and structural analysis, materials and sections; fire services and safety; hydraulic, mechanical, and electrical systems, and the types and applicability of constructional systems to different architectural expressions. 

The unit generates an understanding of the integration of structures and services in medium- to large-scale buildings. The vehicle for this is the combined effect of weekly lectures and workshops. Lectures investigate and critically analyse a number of selected buildings highlighting architectural, structural and technical aspects that pertain to different materials and construction techniques. They also illustrate specialist drawings produced by consultants, including structures and services. In the workshops students conduct an analysis of selected buildings, to identify the relationships between architecture, space, structure and technology. Such analysis evolves weekly through progressive reviews with a tutor at each workshop and it culminates in two submissions during the semester.</td>

As such, it is thought of as an extension and further development of ARCT2030 Materials and Small Constructions. Through a similarly analytical methodology it introduces students to construction techniques of greater complexity, with an emphasis on architecture as an integrated manifestation of structure, body, skin and building services. 

Topics include architectural and structural analysis, materials and sections; fire services and safety; hydraulic, mechanical, and electrical systems, and the types and applicability of constructional systems to different architectural expressions. 

The unit generates an understanding of the integration of structures and services in medium- to large-scale buildings. The vehicle for this is the combined effect of weekly lectures and workshops. Lectures investigate and critically analyse a number of selected buildings highlighting architectural, structural and technical aspects that pertain to different materials and construction techniques. They also illustrate specialist drawings produced by consultants, including structures and services. In the workshops students conduct an analysis of selected buildings, to identify the relationships between architecture, space, structure and technology. Such analysis evolves weekly through progressive reviews with a tutor at each workshop and it culminates in two submissions during the semester.</p></pre>

Attendance to both is a requirement of the Unit and not attending will substantially hinder your learning experience and final outcome.


LECTURES:
These unpack a number of selected buildings and will provide students with the analytical skills required to complete the submissions.
Lectures are a fundamental part of this unit, where most of the content will be delivered, relevant information will be shared and the engagement with the structural engineers will occur, as they will contribute in person to most of the lectures.

LCS provides access to recordings of the lectures however it does not offer the same learning experience when compared to attending lectures, particularly in regards to readability of images and drawings which are crucial in this Unit, and it should be regarded as an option to manage clashes and/or further revisit lectures to focus on specific aspects rather than an alternative to actually attending the lectures in person. 

WORKSHOPS
In the workshops students will progressively review the drawings which will be then finalized for Submissions A and B. Each of the two submissions consists of one digital A1 in PDF format which displays the graphical analysis of the selected building. A template for both Submissions can be found on LMS, and should be followed in great detail.

Submission A
Two-dimensional analysis of a selected building focusing on a significant structural bay

Submission B
Three-dimensional analysis of a selected building focusing on a significant structural bay

Example of both submissions will be shown at the first lecture and will be made available to students during Workshops and via LMS


UNIT WORK FLOW and PROCESS toward SUBMISSIONS A and B

The sequence of tasks related to the above submissions throughout the semester can be summarized below:
- Select two or three medium to large building from the list of recommended Architects (see below);

- Confirm your building selection with Tutor at the first tutorial (see Unit Timetable);

- Research and read extensively about architectural and technical aspects of the selected buildings and review all relevant research with Tutor;

- Remember: you are the expert of the selected building, and you need all your research at hand to review your investigation with your Tutor. Hence all research material has to be brought to each workshop for reference in hard-copy form;

- Investigate and highlight the structural pattern of the entire building in plan and section; how does the building work functionally, structurally and spatially?

- Select a meaningful structural bay and relevant surrounding area to focus you investigation. This should include a full structural bay as well as a façade on at least one side separating the interior from the exterior of the building.

 - Investigate the details and connections of all elements (structure, services, finishes, materials etc.) that appear in the selected area and re-draw these in detail in plan, section and elevation. Drawings will need to convey not only the technical information, including carefully detailed labels, but also the textural qualities of the finishes and materials.

- Drawings can be digitally produced, hand-drawn and may employ any mixed media you wish. Given the nature of the exercise it will be likely that the drawings will require at least the combination of technical line-drawings with digital overlaying techniques (eg. CAD + Photoshop)

- Review the evolution of this investigation and relevant drawings at your weekly workshop;

- Finalize the Two-dimensional analysis and complete Submission A;

- Set out to build the selected structural bay with all its components as a three-dimensional model in software of your choice. This should be a detailed architectural model focusing on the elements uncovered in the investigation completed for Submission A.

- Review the evolution of the three-dimensional model at your weekly workshop.

- Select the view which will constitute the basis for the drawing for Submission B, and confirm it with your Tutor.

- Develop an actual drawing or image of the selected view of the three-dimensional model which conveys the technical information, including carefully detailed labels, and the textural qualities of the finishes and materials.

- Drawings can be digitally produced, hand-drawn and may employ any mixed media as required. Given the nature of the exercise it will be likely that the drawings will require at least the combination of line-drawings, rendering, and digital overlaying techniques.

- Finalize the Three-dimensional analysis and complete Submission B;


GUIDE FOR SELECTION OF ARCHITECT and BUILDING

The main criteria for the selection of your building are:

- The Architect needs to be an internationally recognized architect (eg. Pritzker prize winner or similarly celebrated architect);

- The Building needs to be of medium to large scale of any type but most likely not a single residence (eg. Generally more than 3 levels or 10 meters in height);

- The most important criteria however is that you select a building that truly interests you. 

A list of recommended architects follows:
Tadao Ando, Alejandro Aravena, Shigeru Ban, David Chipperfield, Le Corbusier, Norman Foster, Zaha Hadid, Herzog & DeMeuron, Steven Holl, Toyo Ito, Louis Kahn, Christian Kerez, Rem Koolhass OMA, Kengo Kuma, Paulo Mendes Da Rocha, Rafael Moneo, Morphosis, Nieto Soberano, Pierluigi Nervi, Oscar Niemeyer, Jean Nouvel, Renzo Piano, RCR Architects, Richard Rogers, Kazuyo Sejima, & Ryue Nishisawa SANAA, Wang Shu, Alvaro Siza, Eduardo Souto De Moura, Mies Van der Rohe, Peter Zumthor.

 
GROUPWORK and PLAGIARISM
Please note all aspects of your investigation and submissions are individual: all work presented during the Workshops and prepared for each Submission needs to be solely your own.
Be advised that Tutors will keep records of all selected buildings and relevant students and submissions through the years: all submissions investigating the same buildings will be carefully cross-checked for plagiarism and academic misconduct more generally.

Students should be aware that marks can be adjusted in the period of time between a mark being given for an assessment item and the final mark in the official release of results by Student Administration. Students are referred to Part 1, Section 11.4 of the University Policy on: Assessment under Adjustment of Marks. <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP15%2F5' target='_blank'>http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP15%2F5</a>  
Criterion based assessment is designed to provide a measure of students' performance that is directly relevant to the learning outcomes. This approach to assessment provides an indication of the specific knowledge and skills each student can demonstrate through an assessment task.  The use of moderation (as currently defined in the assessment policy below) can and should be used where appropriate. 

Moderation is defined in the University Policy on Assessment (the Policy) as “a process to ensure consistent, fair and reliable marking against academic standards” (definitions section). It is “employed to ensure appropriate and consistent marking standards within units, and that assessment outcomes are fair and reliable”. 

LMS File Size for Digital Submission 
Unless otherwise stated in this unit outline, please note that the maximum file size for digital upload to the Learning Management System (LMS) is 20MB. Files that are incorrect in format or are substantially over this file size limit may not be marked.  Please allow adequate time to upload to LMS, upload time is not grounds for special consideration.


Authenticity of work
We need to be able to establish the authenticity and authorship of your work, thus the minimum requirement for attendance is defined as no less than half the number of tutorials or studio sessions which are contributing, in process and development, to a submission.

Submission of Late Work 
Unless otherwise stated, all assessment tasks are due no later than 4pm on the date indicated in the unit's Assessment Items, with the exception of in-class assessment items such as tutorial presentations. Any assessment task which is submitted after the time indicated in the assessment items statement without a formal approved extension will be considered LATE and appropriate penalties will be applied. Information on penalties can be obtained in the Policy on Assessment at <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP15%2F5' target='_blank'>http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP15%2F5</a>

Extensions 
The Faculty approves extensions only in exceptional circumstances in order to ensure that all students are treated fairly and that submission date schedules, which are designed to produce ordered work patterns for students, are not disrupted. Extensions may be authorised only by the allocated Faculty Course Advising Office or a delegated representative. In all cases, requests for extensions require the submission of Special Consideration form no later than three University working days after the due date.

Students are encouraged in the strongest possible terms to familiarise themselves with the Policy on Special Consideration available at <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP11%2F23' target='_blank'>http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP11%2F23</a>

Feedback 
Marked assessments submitted on time will be made available for collection by students at least one week before the next assessment in the unit is due (if it is related to the previous assessment), or no more than 15 University working days after submission, whichever is sooner.

Building clean-up and folio collection (for units with folio submissions)
Studios are expected to be left clean and tidy. Drawing boards are to be cleaned. Students must remove all personal property immediately after the submission of their folio. If the content of a folio is used for exhibition then the student must write their name on the back of the work so that when the exhibition is demounted collection is simplified. If staff or the Faculty wish to reserve work for reproduction and/or accreditation purposes then this should be negotiated with individual students.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
