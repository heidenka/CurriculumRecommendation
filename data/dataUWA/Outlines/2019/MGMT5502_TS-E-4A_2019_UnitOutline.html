It comprises a strategic analysis of real world business problems; and a business advisory consulting  report.

Students learn to think strategically and apply key course theories and tools to identify key challenges and opportunities; formulate plausible solutions and initiatives consistent with organisational goals; make informed recommendations regarding the optimal path for the organisation for sustainable performance and apply strategy models, frameworks and tools to strategically transform an organisation. 

Students apply their strategic management and analytical research skills to a real business problem in the completion of the business advisory consulting report. This report is completed in teams and students work on a project identified by a private or public company, a not-for-profit organisation or an industry association. Students are required to present the results of their analysis to both the client and faculty.</td>

In this unit we'll engage in two work streams - firstly a work stream to study strategic management from both academic and practitioner perspectives - and secondly complete the business consulting project itself - which is a proxy for a real-world management consulting engagement. Along the way we sincerely hope that you enjoy the learning experience - and that by the end of the unit you have all added to your skill-sets in both the strategy and management consulting areas. Experience from case studies across many business sectors will help our learning along the way.

Unit content
Please read the following formal description of the unit: This Strategic Analysis & Consulting Project unit is a distinct and unique feature of our UWA Business School MBA Full Time in a number of ways, forming a capstone to your studies. For example:

There are 2 distinct components to this unit a Strategic Management component and a consulting project component.

The Strategic Management/Analysis component comprises the content of a traditional capstone Strategic Management unit which is typically offered within MBA programs. Consequently, this part of the unit will help you to pull together your previous MBA units and learning into an integrative whole. Consequently, through undertaking this component it is envisaged that MBA students will be able to take a generalist perspective when analysing an assortment of organisations and their different strategic contexts.

The consulting project component acts as a bridge between your MBA projects and the real-world of strategic-level business decision-making. It comprises a detailed project proposal for your groups chosen client project which will be presented in both verbal and written form and then a final project presentation and written submission.

Although the Strategic Management component is distinct from the consulting project one, they may also be interlinked. For example, you may be able to choose and apply strategy models / frameworks / theories learnt from the Strategic Management part in order to help you to better understand and analyse the project topic you are investigating for your client. Indeed, as it is envisaged that as the projects investigated will be both strategic and multi-disciplinary in nature, it is likely that your project will make much progress at this time through applying the learning from the Strategic Management part.</p></pre>

More formally, the University regulations state that â€˜to complete a course or unit students shall attend prescribed classes, lectures, seminars and tutorials. Where a student, due to exceptional circumstances, is unable to attend a scheduled class, they are required to obtain prior approval of the unit coordinator to be absent from that class. Any student absent from class without having had such absence approved by the unit coordinator may be referred to the faculty for advice and may be required to withdraw from the unit.</p></pre>

The Harvard style is the preferred and there are some notes for guidance which have been prepared by the library staff: 'Citing your Sources Harvard Style' (<a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/harvard' target='_blank'>http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/harvard</a>).The EndNote software package is a really good system for building up a database of references. Not everyone will want to invest the time in using this system but you should consider it if you intend to build up resource materials or plan to undertake extensive research in a particular area. The library staff have also developed a tutoring package: A Quick Guide to Using EndNote which provides the basics for using EndNote with an essay <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote' target='_blank'>http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote</a> Acknowledging Sources of Information and the Business School Policy on Plagiarism Student Services provides an online plagiarism portal that includes a definition of plagiarism and a link to FAQ www.studentservices.uwa.edu.au/ss/learning/online_services/plagiarism_portal Turnitin' Originality Checking and Plagiarism Prevention is used in the Faculty to allow both educators and their students check written work for improper citation or misappropriated content.

Moderation of marks
The Business School must ensure that the processes of assessment are fair and are designed to maintain the standards of the School and its students. The School follows the UWA marks and grades distribution:
Higher distinction	(HD)	80-100%
Distinction	(D)	70-79%
Credit Pass	(CR)	60-69%
Pass	(P)	50-59%
Fail	(N+)	   45-49%
Fail	(N)	0-44%
Failed component	(FC)	
The moderation of marks to ensure comparability between classes is an acceptable academic practice. The School and Board of Examiners have the right to moderate marks where it is considered necessary to maintain consistency and fairness.

Charter of student rights and responsibilities
The Charter of Student Rights and Responsibilities upholds the fundamental rights of students who undertake their education at the University of Western Australia. The University's charter of Student Rights and Responsibilities is available at www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&id=UP07/132

UniAccess
UniAccess provides services and support to UWA students who wish to disclose a disability or a medical condition. Book to meet with a Disability Officer by contacting Student Wellbeing Reception 6488 2423, Student Central South Wing Level 1, opposite Campus News & Gifts.

Information for students with disabilities
The University has a range of support services, equipment and facilities for students with a disability. If you would like to receive advice on these services please email uniaccess@uwa.edu.au or visit www.uniaccess.uwa.edu.au

Using peer feedback to assess team contributions
The online tool SPARKPLUS may be used to assess individual contributions to team work. You may be required to provide feedback to, and receive feedback from, your team members. Based on a series of answers from each team member SPARKPLUS automatically produces two weighting factors: your RPF and SAPA. The use of SPARKPLUS will be explained in class and more information is available on LMS.

Quality assurance
Your assessed work may also be used for quality assurance purposes, such as to assess the level of achievement of learning outcomes as required for accreditation and audit purposes. The findings may be used to inform changes aimed at improving the quality of Business School programs. All material used for such processes will be treated as confidential, and the outcome will not affect your grade for the unit.

Approved calculators for examinations
The University permits only the use of calculators in examinations when the calculator has an approved sticker and the examiner permits their use. If the student does not have an approved sticker on their calculator, they will not be permitted to use the calculator. Calculators can be approved at the Undergraduate Student Centre, the Postgraduate Student Centre or at Student Administration. Further information is available on the Business School website at www.business.uwa.edu.au/students/assessments

eBooks and open book exams
eBooks cannot be accessed at an examination. Please check your exam details and purchase a printed version of any book you would select to take into an open book exam.</p></pre>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 10 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
