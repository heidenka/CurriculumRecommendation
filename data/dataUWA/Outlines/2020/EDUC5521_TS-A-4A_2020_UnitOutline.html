                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit has four main aims. It will provide opportunities to (1) develop your knowledge of the Technologies Curriculum and associated teaching strategies, (2) locate and explore a range of digital resources to engage students, (3) create an eportfolio of technology-related evidence to support job applications and ongoing career progression, and (4) increase your personal digital literacies, repertoire and confidence with digital technologies as a teaching professional.</p><p>Technologies Curriculum</p><p>A major focus will be the Western Australian Curriculum: Technologies learning area, Pre-primary to Year 6 and its two distinct, but related, subjects of Design and Technologies, and Digital Technologies. With a focus on creating preferred futures, you will explore how Design and Technologies can be integrated into teaching and learning to develop children’s design thinking and to generate and produce solutions for authentic purposes. As part of Digital Technologies, you will explore a range of computing and mobile technologies, including web 2.0 tools and mobile apps, which are relevant to early childhood and primary education. Computational thinking, information systems, and pedagogical approaches to support children to define, design and implement digital solutions, will also be explored. Links will be made to the Early Years Learning Framework for Australia; the Australian Curriculum General Capability, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Capability; and the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (AITSL). As part of this unit, you will complete the nationally accredited University of Adelaide Computer Science Education Research Group (CSER) Digital Technologies - Foundations to 6 MOOC which will provide you with 21 hours of professional learning and certificate.</p><p>Practical Skills and hands-on exploration</p><p>A key aspect of this unit is to provide you with the practical skills you will need to integrate technologies into your teaching and to become a future technology education leader in your professional context. To support this aim, you will hear from a number of ‘rock stars’ in the field of technology education in Western Australia. These highly experienced guest presenters have been invited to extend your learning experience and provide the latest information about current technology education trends. A major focus will be on providing you with hands-on exploration of a range of resources. As part of an assessment, you will investigate how practicing teachers integrate aspects of the Technologies Curriculum into their teaching and learning.</p><p>Digital professional portfolio (Eportfolio)</p><p>To provide evidence that you have met the Technologies-related Australian Professional Graduate Standards for Teachers, a key requirement of this unit is the compilation of a digital professional portfolio. This will be a resource that you will continue to add to and modify as you progress through your teaching career. Graduate Standards 2.6, 3.4 and 4.5, along with evidence of your Personal Learning Network (PLN) under Standards 6 and 7, will need to be included. You will draw from on-campus assessments, lessons taught during professional placement, and experience gained through this unit. It is also important to comment on impact on student learning related to the above Standards, where possible. Your eportfolio, based in the Google Suite of programs, will be suitable for use during a job interview and the skills learned will be transferable to your future transition from provisional to full registration.</p><p>Increase personal repertoire of digital skills and literacies</p><p>By participating fully in this unit, you will also learn about the use of new technologies for the advancement of teacher competencies and educational networking.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

We have a lot of content to cover in a limited number of sessions, so be prepared to be available in remote morning sessions for at least 2 hours and 45 minutes. On the intensive day, be preparared to attend in person for the full day.</p><p>The series of online lectures (CSER MOOC) and the essay should reflect the expectations of AQF Level 9 (described below).</p><p>The unit has been designed to be challenging at AQF Level 9: Masters Degree (Coursework). This means that all your work on assignments and weekly participation must reflect the appropriate level of thinking. This level of thinking includes being able to reflect critically on theory and professional practice; using your cognitive, technical and creative skills to investigate, analyse and synthesise complex information, problems, concepts and theories related to technology education; apply established theories to different bodies of knowledge or practice to generate and evaluate complex ideas and concepts at an abstract level, and you should be able to justify and interpret theoretical ideas, methodologies, conclusions and professional decisions to specialist (such as other teachers) and non-specialist audiences (such as parents). At this level you will develop the technical and communication skills to design, evaluate, implement, analyse and theorise about developments in technology education that contribute to professional practice or scholarship. It is expected that you will be proactive in drawing on theory related to both pedagogy and technology education. Your submitted assignment work will be judged and marked with AQF Level 9 expectations in mind.</p><p>In terms of your generic skills, this unit aims to help you improve your communication skills as you will be engaging in a lot of written and oral communication; problem-solving and creativity in that you will be thinking of appropriate and creative ways to meet the technology education needs of children; and teamwork in that you will work in groups and teams to present a group assignment, and through your active, collaborative participation during the workshops.  As in almost every unit you undertake in your MTeach, your critical thinking skills will be developed as you will evaluate and critique research. When you start looking for employment, employers are very interested in these generic skills.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

This is particularly evident in the delivery and assessment of the Western Australian Curriculum: Technologies learning area, Pre-primary to Year 6 and its two distinct, but related, subjects of Design &amp; Technologies, and Digital Technologies. This assignment is underpinned by completion of the nationally accredited University of Adelaide Computer Science Education Research Group (CSER) F-6 Digital Technologies: Foundations MOOC over eight weeks. This MOOC acts as the lecture component of this unit and will provide you with 21 hours of professional learning, plus a certificate of completion mapped to AITSL standards. Completion of the MOOC activities and associated online tasks is designed to develop your background knowledge about concepts and topics in the Technologies curriculum, as well as highlighting practical examples that can be used in the classroom. The LMS discussion board component is designed for you to engage with the content at a more sophisticated level, to help you to become agile thinkers in terms of integrating technologies into the wider curriculum, and to generate a bank of Technology-related teaching ideas that each of you can draw from. The main purpose of this assignment is to develop your knowledge of the Technologies curriculum and associated teaching and assessment strategies.</p><p>Part A – MOOC. Engage with the online lecture content and complete the weekly task. Post the task on the designated Google Community site and MOOC page as instructed. Post a copy of the completed task to the relevant weekly LMS Discussion Forum. Include the suggested year level and curriculum links that relate to your post (2 marks each week).</p><p>Part B – LMS Discussion Board. Comment on the posts of two of your peers and suggest how these ideas could be applied to teaching of the Digital Technologies or Design and Technology subjects at a specific year level. Your responses must show evidence of being able to analyse, reflect on, and synthesise the ideas of your peers into another curriculum area, year level or context. Evidence of critical reflection, expert judgement, adaptability and professional responsibility is expected (AQF Level 9 Masters). (2 marks each week)</p><p>Assignment 2- Research and planning task</p><p>Full description available at: Assessment 2: Group digital tool review and presentation, and personal technologies teaching plan (including Web 2.0 to support teaching)</p><p>Connected 21st century students need connected 21st century teachers. Connecting locally and globally through social media, or face-to-face, with practicing teachers who routinely integrate technologies will help you ‘tap in’ to an education community that is working to achieve common goals through the sharing of practice, knowledge, innovations and problems. Effective collaboration encourages ongoing observation and feedback, and helps to promote a culture of professional sharing, dialogue, experimentation and constructive critique. Developing your own high quality professional learning culture</p><p>as part of a personal learning network (PLN), has the potential to enhance student learning outcomes and is an important aspect of your ongoing development as a teacher.</p><p>This assignment is concerned with educational networking, and relates to AITSL Graduate Standards 6.4 and 7.4. The overarching purpose of this assignment is to support the creation of a high quality PLN, extend your knowledge of digital educational tools and to cultivate a professional learning culture within this unit. You will work together to research (by contacting local and international practicing teachers through social media) how technology is being used in the teaching community (7.4), collaborate to disseminate this knowledge through a group presentation, share innovative practice by creating a series of lessons based on the tool, and engage in authentic assessment by providing constructive critique and feedback to peers (via LMS peer marking) on those lessons.</p><p>Specifically, the aim of Part A of this assignment is to locate practicing teachers who currently use technologies to enhance their teaching, and to use these PLN connections to explore how a particular digital tool can be used effectively in the classroom. The aim of Part B is to develop a series of four learning experiences based on what you learned about this tool. An additional aim of Part B, is to provide you with an authentic opportunity to use technologies to assess and provide feedback in a real-world context.</p><p>Part A – Group digital tool review (10 marks) and group presentation (10 marks).</p><p>(20 marks)</p><p>Peer feedback provided. Tutor assessed.</p><p>Groups of 3-5 students are assigned one of four topics. Each member of the group is required to use Web 2.0, social media and other means to find teachers who are using the tool in their classroom. Each group member should briefly outline (1-2 minutes each) their research strategy and how their personal learning network (PLN) was impacted (10 marks).</p><p>Group members combine what they have found into a group presentation (20 minutes) to the whole class, addressing the following points related to the AITSL Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (APSTs) Graduate Standards:</p><p>● How is the tool being used in classrooms at various year levels? Provide actual examples with images if possible/appropriate.</p><p>● What teaching strategies are required for this tool to expand student learning? (2.6)</p><p>● How can this tool be used to engage students? (3.4)</p><p>● What are the safe, responsible and ethical use considerations related to integrating this tool into teaching and learning? (4.5)</p><p>● How can the tool be integrated with Design &amp; Technology to create a holistic learning experience?</p><p>● Note: This presentation should be suitable for presentation at a school staff meeting to inform your teacher colleagues (7.4) about this tool. The group should work together to analyse critically, reflect on and synthesise (AQF Level 9 Masters) the information gathered about the tool (10 marks).</p><p>Part B – Personal Teaching Plan (10 marks). Peer assessed.</p><p>(10 marks)</p><p>Individual students will use a free trial of Planbook.com to create a series of four learning experiences that integrate the tool you researched into a unit of work, at your choice of year level. You need only provide explicit detail of the technology-related lessons.</p><p>The teaching plan overview must demonstrate links to the Western Australian Curriculum: Technologies learning area and its two subjects of Design &amp; Technologies, and Digital Technologies. It must also link to the Early Years Learning Framework for Australia (where applicable), the Australian Curriculum General Capabilities (where appropriate), and the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Capability.</p><p>The teaching plan must include a suggestion for an assessment task that includes the tool.</p><p>Assignment 3 - eportfolio</p><p>Full description available at: Assessment 3: Eportfolio (including Graduate Standards 1.2, 2.6, 3.4, 4.5 and PLN to support Standard 7.4) and simulated interview</p><p>Total 40%</p><p>Strong interview skills, in today’s modern and competitive world, are more important than ever. If you fail to impress during a job interview, it could cost you an opportunity. Undertaking a ‘mock’ or simulated interview before you graduate can prepare you for what to expect in a real interview situation, and will provide you with an opportunity to practice articulating what you have learned in this Technologies in the Curriculum unit.</p><p>A Digital Professional Portfolio (eportfolio) is a key requirement of the Master of Teaching course. The Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) mandated that all graduates should be in a position to provide evidence that they have met the Graduate Australian Professional Standards for Teachers. Therefore, preservice teachers are required to (a) demonstrate the Graduate Teacher Standards through the successful completion of on-campus assessments and professional experience contexts, and the collation of a digital professional portfolio, and (b) demonstrate impact on student learning as evidenced through the digital professional portfolio and the Graduate Australian Professional Standards. It is expected that the digital professional portfolio will be a resource that you will continue to add to and modify as you progress through the profession.</p><p>● According to the Teacher Registration Board of Western Australia (TRBWA), evidence should cover a broad scope of the preservice teacher’s knowledge, practice and engagement. Supporting evidence must include all of the focus areas and level descriptors under each of the seven standards. Evidence used to demonstrate achievement against the Graduate Professional Standards should:</p><p>○ be drawn directly from the preservice teacher’s coursework and professional experience.</p><p>○ be derived from a range of sources and must include:</p><p>■ evidence of student learning</p><p>■ evidence and/or observation of the preservice teacher’s teaching</p><p>○ be annotated to reflect achievement of the Graduate Standards by addressing each of the descriptors</p><p>○ show impact on student learning</p><p>Evidence should be drawn from assignments; observational notes; reflections; mentor/supervisor feedback; de-identified student work; curriculum, planning and assessment documents; observations, professional conversations or collaborations with colleagues; resources used at university or during professional experience placements; and student/parent feedback.</p><p>The purpose of this assignment is to showcase your accomplishment at the graduate level in the area of Technologies education, and has two main aims. First, the aim of Part A of this assignment is to provide you with the opportunity to articulate, through a simulated job interview, what you know about the Technologies curriculum and how you would integrate technologies into your teaching.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
