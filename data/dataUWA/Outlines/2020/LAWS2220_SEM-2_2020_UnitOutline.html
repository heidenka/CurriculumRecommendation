                    <p>LAWS2220 - Birth, Life, Death and the Law - SEM-2-2020 - 2020 - Face to face / Blended learning</p>
                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit examines the interaction of the legal system with issues relating to health care, medical research and medical technology. It explores the impact of social, economic, ethical and political influences on the law, and in particular how the law incorporates and responds to these influences. The unit is concerned with how society regulates sensitive and controversial issues associated health care and medical science, and examines how the law interacts with other regulatory methods in relation to these issues. It examines the legal understanding of human bodies, rights and duties associated with health care treatment, and decision-making associated with reproduction and dying. <br><br>The unit is organised around the three themes of Birth, Life and Death. In each topic we will introduce the legal framework and consider the role of law and the way in which the law addresses challenging ethical and social issues. The unit will consider the impact of the law, the limits of legal regulation, and the way in which the law mediates competing interests and values, as well as the issue of law reform.</p></p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Lecture Capture System</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>In accordance with UWA’s policy on lecture capture all lectures* in enabled venues will be recorded and made available to stream and download by enrolled students via the Lecture Capture System (LCS) for the duration of the unit (including Supplementary and Deferred Examinations period).

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>The teaching and learning strategies for this unit are based on active learning. </p><p>Lectures will take place via live online webinars. Lecture webinars will be recorded and uploaded to the Lecture Capture System. The lecture classes will include explanation of concepts, principles and ideas, and discussion of these, often in the context of real-life cases or situations. Lecture classes will be supported by power point slides and lecture outlines. Lecture outlines will be available on LMS by the day of the lecture, and power point slides will be available on LMS soon after the lecture.</p><p>There are on-campus and online Zoom options for tutorial classes. You will be allocated to either an on-campus or online Zoom tutorial by the Class Allocation System. You must attend tutorials only for your allocated stream, day, and time (you cannot switch between tutorials, or between on-campus and online tutorials). Tutorial classes will include discussion and activities based on set readings and questions. It is essential that students prepare for the tutorials by pre-reading and addressing the set questions, so that class discussion is focused and engaging. I aim to create an environment in which students are comfortable to extend, explore and test their knowledge and views. I expect discussion to be conducted in a professional way that demonstrates respect for others, accepting that class members may hold quite different views on the subjects arising for discussion. I hope you carefully consider these different perspectives and that you will critique your own views and consider whether they are based on evidence and logic. </p><p>You will need to spend an average of 8-10 hours per week on this unit in order to meet the expectations and achieve the outcomes. This includes class time, reading and preparing for lectures and tutorials, reviewing unit materials, researching and writing the assignment, and studying for the final exam.</p></p></pre></p>

The lectures will introduce the legal framework and will raise social, ethical, economic and political issues relevant to the topic. Classes will include discussion around specific issues and questions, often based on a case study, video, or a reading which students are asked to view or read in advance of the lecture. Students are encouraged to attend the live webinar lectures, then use the recordings only for revision purposes.</p><p>Tutorials: One 1-hour tutorial per week. Tutorial classes will be used to explore particular issues in depth. Discussion will be based on readings and questions for each tutorial. Students are required to attend tutorials on their allocated day, time, and stream (on-campus or online).</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
