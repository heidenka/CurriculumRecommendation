                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>Welcome to this unit in International Management. There is often some confusion in the minds of students regarding the difference between international management courses and international business courses. Both courses cover similar material, but there is a difference in focus and emphasis. Generally, international business courses tend to concentrate on politics, economics and trade, and the functional areas of business such as marketing, logistics, and accounting. International management courses tend to focus on the basic functions of a manager (planning, organising, leading and controlling), and consequently the emphasis is on understanding business contexts, evaluating opportunities and strategic options, cross-cultural issues, organising resources, structuring the business, and managing employees.</p><p>International managers, of course, work in international businesses. The term “international business” refers to all business activities that involve more than one country. For the purposes of the current course, this includes activities that are conducted by individuals, small companies, large companies, groups of companies, government agencies, international agencies and not for profit organisations. It can involve activities as simple as a consumer mail order business, or as complex as a multinational media, banking, mining or manufacturing organisation. Business activities can include the sourcing or supplying of capital, raw materials, technology, intellectual property or labour, and consequently international business courses usually cover the functional areas of business (finance, marketing, accounting, law, HR etc). International business differs from domestic business primarily because of the level of complexity involved. This is not to say that all domestic businesses are simple and all international businesses are complex, but as a general rule, business becomes more complex when national boundaries are crossed.</p><p>“International management” refers to the set of competencies and skills required for international business. The basic skill set for international managers is identical to that required for success in domestic management, but international managers also need to know something about the differences that exist between their home country and the countries in which they intend to operate.</p><p>Competing in international markets has become a crucial activity for most corporations and even for many small to medium size companies. Setting up facilities in different countries, transfer of managers across national boundaries and increased international trading have profoundly influenced the design and operation of organisations that have internationalised or "globalised". Internationalisation has also impacted upon organisations which have "stayed home" yet found themselves competing against "intruders" from abroad. It is a truism that our home market is everyone else’s export market.</p><p>These developments have created the need for managers in many organisations to adapt and change to meet the demands created by the new environment they face. Management is now a multi-national and multi-cultural issue, at a minimum a regional issue, and more often than not a "global" issue. To confuse things a little however, it is to some extent true that only the economic environment has expanded globally. The politcal environment has remained mainly nationally defined, while people's cultural identities are often based on ethnic groupings even smaller than their nation state.</p><p>This unit adopts a comparative management approach, and it examines how managers can achieve desired organisational results through planning, organising, communicating and controlling work activities across cultures. As an introductory unit, the course seeks to cover international management broadly, while emphasising issues of particular relevance to students in Australia and the Indo-Pacific region. Australians are reasonably familiar with business in their traditional European and American markets, where business philosophies, ethics and operations are similar to their own. They tend not to be so familiar or comfortable working in the Asian region, despite the great increase in business dealings in this region. Similarly, many Asians are comfortable managing business activities in their own region, but are less familiar with working in Australia or other Western cultures.</p><p>Students of International Management must realise, however, that much of the information they study regarding managing in the international arena does not fit into nice, neat frameworks. Research results are often conflicting, and serious doubts are regularly raised about previously accepted findings. In addition, the area is very dynamic and the workable solutions of today are often not applicable tomorrow. None-the-less, this unit should provide a good basic framework for the student or manager interested in the topic.</p><p><strong>Unit Content</strong></p><p>International Management is an introductory unit dealing with the globalisation of business and the management of those businesses. The focus is on those business activities that cross national boundaries including movements of goods, services, capital, personnel and technology. The unit presents conceptual frameworks for the analysis of international business management problems and issues encountered by multinational corporations as well as small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in exporting and other forms of international business. This includes such topics as the interaction of international business firms with host country economic, political, social and cultural environments; political and business risk analysis; formation and management of international joint ventures; multi- national organisation structure and design; formulation of global business strategies, policies and planning and control systems; the characteristics of international managers and their selection, training and career management; the management of expatriate and foreign workforces; ethics and international business.</p><p><strong>Unit Goals</strong></p><p>The unit goal is to help you develop an understanding of international management, the people who conduct business internationally and the various factors that impact on international operations – culture and business processes, strategy, organisational design, and people management. The unit adds a global dimension to the other units studied in the MBA.</p><p><strong>Lecture Capture System</strong></p><p>LCS is not implemented for this unit due to the highly interactive teaching style.</p></p></pre></p>

Methods may include lectures, article reviews, case studies, role plays, class debates, incident studies, field work and guided discussion. The teaching strategy is designed to provide the variety of experiences needed to understand the complexities of the business environment and the wide choice of information sources available to those who want to study the topics in more detail. While some methods may not appeal to you, you should be prepared to participate in each of them in order to not lose the learning opportunities inherent in their use. Do not let teaching style or method inhibit your chances to absorb the substance of the unit.</p></pre></p>

More formally, the University regulations state that ‘to complete a course or unit students shall attend prescribed classes, lectures, seminars and tutorials’. Where students, due to exceptional circumstances, are unable to attend a scheduled class, they are required to obtain prior approval of the unit coordinator to be absent from that class. Any student absent from class without having had such absence approved by the unit coordinator may be referred to the faculty for advice and may be required to withdraw from the unit.</p></pre></p>

The Harvard style is the preferred used unless otherwise stated by the unit coordinator. There are some notes for guidance which have been prepared by the library staff: ‘Citing your Sources Harvard Style’ . The EndNote software package is a really good system for building up a database of references. Not everyone will want to invest the time in using this system but you should consider it if you intend to build up resource materials or plan to undertake extensive research in a particular area.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
