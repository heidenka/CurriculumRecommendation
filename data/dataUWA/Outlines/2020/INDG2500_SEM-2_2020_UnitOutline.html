                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit examines the historical, political and social processes of colonisation in Australia with a specific focus on four distinct northern areas of Western Australia—the Kimberley, Pilbara, Murchison and Gascoyne regions. The unit begins with an introduction to the 60,000 year history of Aboriginal people in the North and the significance of Country. We will then examine the actions of colonisation and effects these have had on Country, Aboriginal people’s connection to Country in the North and the impact on Aboriginal peoples and communities. Together with this, the unit will explore and interrogate the global importance of these areas in terms of industry and mining and how these often compete with obligations to land from local Aboriginal groups</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>The Learning and Teaching Strategy of this unit will be delivered in a blended mode with both online and face to face components.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Lectures&nbsp;</u></strong></p><p>Pre-recorded lectures accessible online, accessed in the 'Online Workshop Preparation Tasks' in the Weekly Topics folders.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Flipped Classroom</u></strong></p><p>The Flipped Classroom Learning and Teaching Strategy of this unit is based on current educational research in the Higher Education sector. The Flipped Classroom strategy provides specific guides and tasks for your Essential Readings/Viewings in the form of 'Online Workshop Preparation Tasks'. This enables your reading focus and preparation for classes to ve much clearer to follow and as a result enables you to use workshops to engage in deeper understandings of the content. Additionally, this design prepares us for unpredicted Covid 19 responses and any requirement to go back fully online. For more information on Flipped Classrooms you can access this link:<br></p><p>&nbsp;<u><a href='https://uniwa.sharepoint.com/sites/uwastaffintranet/forms/Teaching/Documents/154430_flipped%20classroom%20booklet%20v4.pdf' target='_blank' >https://uniwa.sharepoint.com/sites/uwastaffintranet/forms/Teaching/Documents/154430_flipped%20classroom%20booklet%20v4.pdf</a></u></p><p><strong><i>Online Workshop Preparation Tasks</i></strong></p><p>Online workshop preparation tasks include: </p><p>- a self assessed lecture review quiz weeks 2-11;</p><p>&nbsp;- Essential Reading/Viewing - guided reading components (article extracts or a full article); and/or Essential Viewing - guided viewing components&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(video clips or full video);</p><p>- the notes pertaining to reading/viewing to bring to the workshop for the workshop activity to assist discussion/activities;</p><p>- discussion board post based on a set question connecting with the guided essential reading/viewing (approx 100 words).&nbsp;</p><p>This format also makes transition to online classes smoother in the event Covid 19 Restrictions require us to go fully online.</p><p><strong><i>Unit Readings</i></strong></p><p>Unit Readings are located in our LMS menu, it is a catalogue attached the UWA Library and contains all the Essential Readings/Viewings. Unit Readings also contains Recommended Readings and Viewings. The Recommended Reading and Viewings are for you own deeper enquiry but most importantly they are to be used as fundamental sources in your assignments. You can download and print the whole catalogue.</p><p><strong><i>Workshops</i></strong></p><p>A dialogic and transformative learning approach is fundamental to the workshop design of this unit (for you own information <a href='http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1002.9078&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf' target='_blank' >http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1002.9078&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a>). Workshops will be interactive using both activity based and dialogic approaches. To be able to engage in the classroom dialogue and activities students will need to reflect on and analyse their understandings the content/points in unit materials provided in online preparation tasks on LMS and in lectures. A dialogic and transformative learning approach requires students to reflect on and share understandings and perspectives about the unit content/points being raised. Critical reflective components of the activities and the dialogic approaches are designed stimulate students’ transformative learning and facilitate deeper understandings. An online interactive learning tool <strong>"Padlet" </strong>will be used in class as a recap and reflection strategy to support your learning and understanding. Each class will be given a link which can be accessed via smartphone, ipad and other devices. A short video Padlet demonstration will be accessible in the Weekly Topics folder under "Padlet" located at the top of the page above Week 1.</p><p>Workshop guides have been designed to provide some background information on the week’s content and weekly tasks in a format you can download and are accessible in the Weekly Topics folders.<br></p><p>To be able to engage fully in your learning ensure you prepare for your workshops by accessing the weekly workshop guide and by completing the Online Preparation Tasks on LMS.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

Read the guidelines carefully. You are required to include footnoted citations and include a reference list. Supportive figures, illustrations used in the essay should be referenced in their titlesThere are no prescribed texts. Weekly essential and recommended readings and viewings can be accessed and a list downloaded from INDG2500 LMS in Unit Readings at anytime and specific guides for readings and viewing are the weekly folders under Online Workshop Preparation tasks, as released.</p><p>Recommended Websites</p><p>The websites listed below are helpful web resources for this unit.</p><p>AIATSIS – Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies</p><p><a href='https://aiatsis.gov.au/' target='_blank' >https://aiatsis.gov.au/</a></p><p>Review of the Aboriginal Heritage Act</p><p><a href='https://www.dplh.wa.gov.au/aha-review' target='_blank' >https://www.dplh.wa.gov.au/aha-review</a> using footnoted citations. Essays and assignments will be assessed according to the adherence of these referencing standards. </p><p>Presentation Formats It is recommended that essays be typed. Essay text should be 12 point, in a clear font, e.g. Arial, Helvetica, Times, New York, Palatino or similar, with lines one and one-half spaced. Paragraphs should be denoted by a single extra return (you may indent paragraphs if you wish). </p><p>Please do not use extraneous formatting, such as headers, footers or tabs if they are not necessary. Please include page numbers. The required length of the essay does not include footnotes. Students must provide a word count at the top of their assessment item at the time of submission. Refer to further essay requirements in the Assessment Brief.</p><p>Important Note: You will be allowed 3 submission attempts so that you can check your Turnitin 'originality report' to ensure you have paraphrased/quoted adequately and acknowledged the sources. Further information on how to do this and on text matching can be found via this link: <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/textmatching/forstudents' target='_blank' >http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/textmatching/forstudents</a>. </p><p><strong>Plagiarism&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Academic misconduct includes plagiarism, collusion and other forms of cheating. The University of Western Australia defines Academic Misconduct as "any activity or practice engaged in by a student that breaches explicit guidelines relating to the production of work for assessment, in a manner that compromises or defeats the purpose of that assessment". Plagiarism occurs when someone disguises or misrepresents the authorship of work and claims it as his or her own. It can occur in various forms:&nbsp;</p><p>(i) presenting, part or whole of another student's essay, design project or artwork as one's own;&nbsp;</p><p>(ii) copying phrases, sentences or passages from a published source (usually an article or a book) without acknowledging this by quotation marks and a reference;&nbsp;</p><p>(iii) substantially copying design elements or images from other design projects or artworks, such as to misrepresent the substance, strategy or personal expression of the original design project or artwork;&nbsp;</p><p>(iv) presenting in your own words an idea, argument or interruption from another source, without indicating the reference Remember always insert references when using other people's ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>What are the penalties? Plagiarism strikes at the heart of ethical scholarship, and the School has grown increasingly concerned about plagiarism in student essays. In addition to being a form of fraud, plagiarism negates the value of essays, designs or artworks as a means of developing independent thought, analysis, design strategy or creative expression. Unintentional plagiarism will also be penalised. The University views plagiarism very seriously and substantial or repeated plagiarism may result in a student's failing the course or, in extreme cases, being expelled from the University. The defense "but I have done this for other departments or teachers" is unacceptable - it is rather like the driver who, when caught speeding, complains that (s)he hasn't been caught before.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to Avoid Plagiarism&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The best way to avoid plagiarism in essay writing is to get into the habit of distinguishing your own work from that by other people. We assume that unreferenced work is your own, so make sure that phrases and sentences that are not your own are in quotation marks and given precise references, and that ideas and arguments that are not your own are properly referenced. In cases of concepts or facts that are widely used or known this may not be necessary - for example "liberals believe in the importance of individual freedom" or "Australia has six states". To avoid accidental plagiarism, ensure that the notes you use to prepare your essay clearly identify quotations and have full references.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

These are Truths that are over 60, 000 years old, long before the 200 year history of colonisation of the North and of Australia. The lecture will also begin your journey in understanding the silenced truths behind the histories of colonisation of the North and the significance these truths have for Country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><i>Week 2&nbsp;</i></strong></p><p>Lecture: Belonging to Country: Heartsick for Country, The Killing Fields of Murujuga, ‘The Flying Foam Massacre (Massacres 19th Century)</p><p>Workshop Focus: Introductions and Interrogating How We Know History</p><p>We commenced the unit with an introduction to the 60,000 year history of Aboriginal people in the North and the significance of Country. We will now begin to examine the competing histories by viewing and listening to the histories and voices of Aboriginal people. You would have watched the film Exile and the Kingdom in your recommended workshop hours last week. On the other side of this is the story of colonisation, throughout this unit we question what we know and interrogate the process of knowing.</p><p>In today’s workshop we will interrogate how we know history through the discussion of  your notes on the film ‘Exile and the Kingdom’ and this week’s seminar Flying Foam Massacre – The Killing Fields of Murujuga’, and we will begin to examine representations of the colonisation of the north. Bastian’s article ‘Reading Colonial Records Through an Archival Lens: The Provenance of Place, Space and Creation’ will be significant in opening the lenses you use to read and engage in archival/historical records and information.</p><p><strong>Week 3</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Lecture: Jandamarra (white fella name ‘Pigeon’)</p><p>Workshop Focus: Resistance: Fighting for Country and People  </p><p>The focus of this week’s workshop is on Jandamarra and the Bunuba resistance. June Oscar AO writes in the forward of Howard Pederson’s and Banjo Worrunmurra’s book ‘Jandamarra and the Bunuba Resistance’:</p><p>“As a young girl growing up in Bunuba country I heard Jandamara’s story form my old people many times. While the story was known by all Bunuba people, Grandfather Wirranmarra (Banjo Worrunmurra) knew the full version. It was his responsibility to keep telling the story so that we, the Bunuba people, would never lose our history, our sense of wonder at the magic and power of our country and the knowledge of the deep injustices inflicted on our people from those who invaded our country.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Week 4</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Lecture: ‘Stations, Finger Money: Stolen Wages’</p><p>Workshop Focus: Station Life – Indentured Labour and Slavery</p><p>This week we focus particularly on Aboriginal people in the North who worked on pastoral stations because they stayed on their Country. However, Aboriginal people working on stations were often treated like slave labour. Different forms of legislation ensured that the pastoralists could maintain control of their Aboriginal labour force and this was enforced by the police. The labour experiences of Aboriginal people of course changed over time and the readings provide perspectives of these different times.</p><p><strong>Week 5</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Lecture “Post-Colonial—NOT!” [Anita Heiss, 2009] Sovereignty and Colonisation of the North: A time to stop and reflect.</p><p>Workshop Focus: Sovereignty and Colonisation of the North: Nation Rebuilding</p><p>“The term ‘post‐colonial’ is used generally to describe all cultures affected by the imperial process from the moment of colonisation to the present day. It is also considered as the most appropriate term for the new cross‐cultural criticism which has emerged in recent years and for the discourse through which it is constituted.”   Five years after Mabo 1992, Irene Watson argued “… [t]erra nullius has not stopped; the violations of our law have continued, the ecological destruction of the earth our mother continues with a vengeance, we are still struggling to return to the land, and the assimilator-integrator model is still being forced upon us.”  Nearly, twenty years later, Irene Watson writes, ‘the future is our past, we once were sovereign and we still are’ .&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Week 6</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Lecture: “The Untold History of Policing in the Kimberley District”</p><p>Workshop Focus: Criminalising Resistance</p><p>How did Aboriginal people resist colonial incursions on their lands? We’ve already looked at the example of Jandamarra who is considered a freedom fighter but how else did Aboriginal people resist colonization? The livestock was sacred in the eyes of the pastoralists for it was the means to their attaining their wealth. Pastoralists viewed the livestock as their property and they considered the spearing of livestock a criminal offence. However, when Aboriginal people speared livestock it was not only for meat to eat, it was also because the livestock was destroying the waterholes and their country they had owned in their families eternally. Not all forms of resistance were obvious like Jandamarra’s fight, Choo’s and Owen’s readings provide some insights to other forms of resistance that were seen as crimes. You will also find the newspaper articles both sets of readings will be helpful in identifying some of the different forms of resistance by Aboriginal people of the North, particularly against pastoralist and station owners.</p><p><strong>Week 7</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Lecture: The Kimberley and Global Connectivity</p><p>Workshop Focus: Pearling, Slaving, Blackbirding in the North</p><p>This week we will look at early trade and global connections in the North and in our workshop we will particularly focus on pearling. Country, which includes land, seas and waterways in the North was and still is rich in resources. Industries in the North such as the pearling industry have been built on exploitation and inhuman treatment.  “The pearling industry had a notorious reputation for blackbirding, high mortality rates and sexual abuse of women and girls”.  Often, Aboriginal men, women and children were captured and forcibly taken far away (usually in neck and ankle chains) to dive for pearls or stations. Many died from the inhuman treatment, abuse, less than human working conditions and killings for non-compliance. </p><p><strong>Week 8</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Lecture: Frontier Wars: 20th Century Massacres and Dispossession</p><p>Workshop Focus: History told through personal stories and Aboriginal artists who painted their history.</p><p>For many of us there has been a lacking in knowing about our collective past since the onset of colonisation in Australia . Personal knowledge of this past from Aboriginal people of the North has only recently confronted Australians in the latter part of the 20th century. We have mainly learned of this past from personal accounts collected by linguists and anthropologists working in the north. However, recent years have seen the development of Aboriginal led research, writing and publications by Aboriginal people and Communities documenting and telling their own stories. Importantly, there has been the development of a long awaited recognition of the passing on of culture, history and knowledge through visual images as well as the growth in Aboriginal artists who are painting their cultural histories. Additionally, significant development in research has seen the uncovering of evidence of massacres committed in the 20th Century.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Week 9&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Lecture: The 1946 Aboriginal Pastoral Workers Strike</p><p>Workshop Focus: 20th Century resistance: The Significance of Resistance and Global Connections</p><p>The story of the 1946 Aboriginal Pastoral Workers' Strike is one that has never officially ended. An event more important than the Eureka Stockade but never recorded in written histories - the passive resistance by 800 Aboriginal station workers against the appalling living and working conditions thrust upon them. </p><p>‘Australian industrial relations have scarcely touched upon the dispute because it does not fit within the normal institutional framework of the Australian industrial system. It does not, for example, fit in with the conventional demands of workers, for it was always a dispute that involved more than just wages and conditions. Indeed, strikers refused to return to work even when the wages and conditions initially demanded had been implemented.’&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Week 10 STUDY BREAK - NO CLASSES</strong></p><p><strong>Week 11</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Lecture: PART 1- ‘Injury and desecration: the Disturbance of Significant sites in the northwest and Kimberley’</p><p>Workshop Focus: Whose Law, Whose Land?: Mining and Native Title</p><p>In the 60,000 year plus history of Australia, the law came from the land and the Aboriginal people’s across the continent belonged to the land. The myth of terra nullius was declared only 200 years ago, with the British assertion of sovereignty in 1788. It was not until 3 June 1992 that the Mabo determination overturned the terra nullius fiction. Mabo 1992 provided the impetus for legislating Land Rights and Native Title. This week through the case study of the Nookanbah Native Title struggle we will examine whose law and whose land has been significant and in dispute through the continuing struggle between mining and Native Title. We will also begin to interrogate, what actually is at the centre of this struggle</p><p><strong>Week 12</strong></p><p>Lecture: PART 2 - ‘Protecting Australia's oldest heritages</p><p>Workshop Focus: Country and Natural Resources: Contested Ground</p><p>Aboriginal people and their ancestors have lived in the lands in the North for millennia, as have Aboriginal people in other regions of Australia. Land and water were and still are sacred and integral to cultural belief systems as well as for survival and sustenance. However, since the 18th Century as Duff 2017 asserts, “For more than two centuries of Australian law and policy regulating freshwater resources, the rights and interests of Aboriginal people were largely ignored until quite recently. Although statutory land rights have existed since the 1970s, and native title has been recognised since 1992 with the courts gradually clarifying a range of questions about its application to land and marine areas, the laws that regulate freshwater consistently failed to address Aboriginal peoples’ needs, priorities, and traditional-legal entitlements.”  This week we will use two articles (Yu 1999 and Rumley &amp; Barber 2004) as case studies to examine the cultural significance of water to Aboriginal people in the Kimberley, the Pilbara people and it’s importance to survival and sustenance.  We will refer to a current AITSIS 2017 research report on Native Title and Freshwater Outcomes to assist in exploring the relationship between water (a cultural and natural resource), Native Title and Common Law. Groups will be allocated a case study and will read that particular article and the reference article in preparation for the workshop.</p><p><strong>Week 13</strong></p><p>Lecture:&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14px;">Continuing history narratives in the North: Current issues impacting on Country, Aboriginal Heritage and Culture.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Workshop focus: This week we will focus on current issues impacting on Country, Aboriginal Heritage and Culture.

This guide is to inform you on preferred terminology for the School of Indigenous Studies, so you can become more confident in your choices about what terms to use. However, it is not definitive and cannot cover all contexts, so as a general rule, if in doubt, ASK first!</p><p><strong><i>Collective and Inclusive Terms</i></strong></p><p>‘Indigenous people(s)’ and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people(s)’ are terms commonly used to collectively refer to Australia’s first peoples.  </p><p>‘Indigenous peoples’ is a term most frequently used in an international context, particularly in relation to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) and The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples www.social.un.org/index/IndigenousPeoples.aspx</p><p>For more information see:  Indigenous Peoples Indigenous Voices Fact Sheet: Who Are Indigenous Peoples?  www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf</p><p>Some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people object to using the term ‘Indigenous’ because it fails to respect their own identity and preferences and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ is the preferred term. </p><p>However, both terms ‘Indigenous people(s)’ and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people(s)’ are acceptable to use in the course. Use capital letters for ‘Indigenous’ and ‘Aboriginal’ when you are referring specifically to Aboriginal peoples in Australia.</p><p>In many areas, the term ‘Aboriginal people’ is increasingly used in preference to ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’.  In Western Australia there has been a clear and stated community preference for use of the term ‘Aboriginal people’ as the inclusive term rather than ‘Indigenous’ or ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’. This is demonstrated by the following examples from two key government agencies:  </p><p>•	In 2013, Western Australia’s Department of Indigenous Affairs replaced the term ‘Indigenous’ in its title with ‘Aboriginal’, its stated reason being that: "The Department of Aboriginal Affairs (formerly Indigenous Affairs) has been renamed to more accurately reflect the identity of Aboriginal people in Western Australia. This change is in line with requests from the State's Aboriginal community." <a href='http://www.daa.wa.gov.au/' target='_blank' >http://www.daa.wa.gov.au/</a></p><p>•	The Department of Health (WA) stated rationale on using the term ‘Aboriginal’ is that: "Within Western Australia, the term Aboriginal is used in preference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, in recognition that Aboriginal people are the original inhabitants of Western Australia. No disrespect is intended to our Torres Strait Islander colleagues and community”. <a href='http://www.aboriginal.health.wa.gov.au/home/' target='_blank' >http://www.aboriginal.health.wa.gov.au/home/</a></p><p>‘Aboriginal people(s)’ is also appropriate to use in the course. </p><p><strong><i>Diverse Communities</i></strong></p><p>‘Aboriginal’ and ‘Indigenous’ are both terms imposed after colonisation, which don’t reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of the more than 250 Aboriginal language groups across Australia as well as the diversity within each of these groups. </p><p>Aboriginal peoples prefer to identify themselves in their own language terms e.g. Noongar, Palyku, Yamatji.  Students should be sensitive to this use, but care should be taken to have an appropriate Aboriginal reference point when using these terms. It can be confusing as spellings may have changed over time or may merely reflect regional or individual preferences. For example, UWA uses ‘Noongar’ as per the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council <a href='http://www.noongar.org.au' target='_blank' >http://www.noongar.org.au</a></p><p><strong><i>Language and Terminology to Avoid</i></strong><br></p><p>The term ‘Aborigine(s)’ is often regarded as having negative connotations and is now regarded as less appropriate, out-dated or even offensive, so use ‘Aboriginal people’ instead.</p><p>Generally avoid abbreviations, as they are like to be offensive.</p><p>•	There is no acceptable abbreviation for ‘Aboriginal’. </p><p>•	Do not use ATSI as an abbreviation of ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’ in written or oral communication.  Exceptions to this are in the context of a recognised acronym for an organisation e.g. ‘AIATSIS’ is the acronym for the ‘Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies’.</p><p>Avoid using anthropological terms such as clans, tribes. Aboriginal people do not generally use these terms in Western Australia you can refer instead to ‘Aboriginal communities’ or ‘Aboriginal language groups’. </p><p>‘Aboriginal’ and ‘non-Aboriginal’ people should be used in preference to ‘black’ and ‘white’ people etc.  </p><p>While Aboriginal people may use terms/language to refer to themselves, such as ‘blackfellas’, this does not imply permission for other people to use such terms.</p><p>For further guidelines on the use of appropriate language please refer to the Queensland based:</p><p><a href="x" target='_blank' >http://www.ipswich.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/10043/appropriate_indigenous_terminoloy.pdf</a>The' target='_blank' ><a href='http://www.ipswich.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/10043/appropriate_indigenous_terminoloy.pdf' target='_blank' >http://www.ipswich.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/10043/appropriate_indigenous_terminoloy.pdf</a>The</a> term ‘Aborigine(s)’ is often regarded as having negative connotations and is now regarded as less appropriate, out-dated or even offensive, so use ‘Aboriginal people’ instead.<br></p><p><strong><i>Generally avoid abbreviations, as they are like to be offensive.</i></strong></p><p>•	There is no acceptable abbreviation for ‘Aboriginal’. </p><p>•	Do not use ATSI as an abbreviation of ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’ in written or oral communication.

                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
