Students will extend their legal research and writing skills developed through earlier study, and practice precedent management and application. Through a series of workshops and practical exercises, students will use critical thinking to create and articulate legal solutions for hypothetical clients, and will build on oral presentation, client communication and career management skills. Students will consider the evolving role and use of technology in enhancing legal practice, with a focus on electronic conveyancing, artificial intelligence and social media and the law. The unit incorporates consideration of the ethical and social justice overlay of professional practice and seeks to prepare students practically, personally and ethically for the professional workplace.</td>

We proceed on the assumption of solid command of the subject matter of pre-requisite core units and work with this as a vehicle for refining your legal, professional and technological competence</div><div><p>Skills are best developed by doing, or in other words, by practice and participation. Participation also enables continuous feedback from both teaching staff and peers, which in turn enhances learning. For this reason, and owing to the intensive nature of the unit and the range of presenters from the profession, <strong>this unit is not recorded.</strong></p><p>Attendance is compulsory to maximise the benefit of the program. We also ask that you show respect for our external presenters by actively participating in their workshop sessions.<br></p></div><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content.

Classes will be lead by a range of Law School staff in combination with experienced and senior members of the profession. The focus is on active learning through a range of interactive exercises. There will also be some set reading and on-line preparatory quizzes. <br></p><p>Whilst the development of skills and competencies is a personal journey, the speed at which you learn and develop will increase proportionately to the frequency and quality of practice. We strongly encourage your active participation throughout all aspects of the unit, as this will benefit each of you individually and the cohort collectively. <br></p><p>There will be times when we ask you to share work with your peers and to comment critically and constructively on other students' work. We ask that you demonstrate respect, empathy and an ethical and professional approach in your dealings with peers and presenters. <br></p></p></pre></p>

This will be important to note for students who are by nature quieter. They may be engaged, though speak less often.</p><p><i>Preparation</i> might be evident in notes the student has come with or in the quality of answers and comments in discussion.</p><p><i>Understanding</i> of the issues raised in tutorials will most commonly be demonstrated though a student’s overall contribution to the tutorial discussion, including small group discussions within a tutorial, whether by way of answering questions, asking questions, making observations, or listening and responding to other students. </p><p><i>Reflection</i> on the issues (and preparation) might be evident in the student drawing on material outside the material directly related to the tutorial problem, perhaps from other topics in the course and in questions asked during (or even after) the tutorial seminar;</p><p><i>Responsible tutorial membership</i> refers to the respect given to other student’s comments and refraining from attempting to dominate the discussion.</p><p> Participation is about the quality not necessarily the quantity of contributions (where ‘quality’ means considered and reflective contributions – you are allowed to make mistakes!). The aim of including this component is to encourage unselfconscious discussion amongst students, not an atmosphere of assessment.</p><p>Further details, including a marking rubric, are available in the 'Tutorials' folder on LMS.<br></p></p></pre></p>

Those who undertake external work, travel or sporting commitments are expected to plan these around their studies. Except in exceptional circumstances, these commitments are not accepted as grounds for a variation in the prescribed sequence of units,* or as valid reasons for timetable changes, swapping tutorials, the waiving of pre-requisites or variation from the prescribed course structure.* In making a decision as to whether to complete the JD on a full or part-time basis, students must be aware that the estimated time commitment for a standard full-time enrolment is approximately 40 hours per week (over each 12 week semester), excluding examinations. Each unit, including intensive units in non-standard teaching periods, requires an overall time commitment of 150 hours.</p><p> </p><p>* Students accepted into the UWA Elite Athletes Program, or who undertake exchange or other commitments which involve official representation of the Law School or the University, may seek approval from the Deputy Head of School (Students) for a variation in the prescribed course structure. </p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
                    <p>If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend</li>
                        <li>serious injury</li>
                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
                    </ul>
