                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit has four main aims. It will provide opportunities to (1) develop your knowledge of the Technologies Curriculum and associated teaching strategies, (2) locate and explore a range of digital resources to engage students, (3) create an eportfolio of technology-related evidence to support job applications and ongoing career progression, and (4) increase your personal digital literacies, repertoire and confidence with digital technologies as a teaching professional.</p><p><strong>Technologies Curriculum</strong></p><p>A major focus will be the Western Australian Curriculum: Technologies learning area, Pre-primary to Year 6 and its two distinct, but related, subjects of Design and Technologies, and Digital Technologies. With a focus on creating preferred futures, you will explore how Design and Technologies can be integrated into teaching and learning to develop children’s design thinking and to generate and produce solutions for authentic purposes. As part of Digital Technologies, you will explore a range of computing and mobile technologies, including web 2.0 tools and mobile apps, which are relevant to early childhood and primary education. Computational thinking, information systems, and pedagogical approaches to support children to define, design and implement digital solutions, will also be explored. Links will be made to the Early Years Learning Framework for Australia; the Australian Curriculum General Capability, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Capability; and the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (AITSL). As part of this unit, you will complete the nationally accredited University of Adelaide Computer Science Education Research Group (CSER) Digital Technologies - Foundations to 6 MOOC which will provide you with 21 hours of professional learning and certificate.</p><p><strong>Practical Skills and hands-on exploration</strong></p><p>A key aspect of this unit is to provide you with the practical skills you will need to integrate technologies into your teaching and to become a future technology education leader in your professional context. To support this aim, you will hear from a number of ‘rock stars’ in the field of technology education in Western Australia. These highly experienced guest presenters have been invited to extend your learning experience and provide the latest information about current technology education trends. A major focus will be on providing you with hands-on exploration of a range of resources. As part of an assessment, you will investigate how practicing teachers integrate aspects of the Technologies Curriculum into their teaching and learning.</p><p><strong>Digital professional portfolio (Eportfolio)</strong></p><p>To provide evidence that you have met the Technologies-related Australian Professional Graduate Standards for Teachers, a key requirement of this unit is the compilation of a digital professional portfolio. This will be a resource that you will continue to add to and modify as you progress through your teaching career. Graduate Standards 2.6, 3.4 and 4.5, along with evidence of your Personal Learning Network (PLN) under Standards 6 and 7, will need to be included. You will draw from on-campus assessments, lessons taught during professional placement, and experience gained through this unit. It is also important to comment on impact on student learning related to the above Standards, where possible. Your eportfolio, based in the Google Suite of programs, will be suitable for use during a job interview and the skills learned will be transferable to your future transition from provisional to full registration.</p><p><strong>Increase personal repertoire of digital skills and literacies</strong></p><p>By participating fully in this unit, you will also learn about the use of new technologies for the advancement of teacher competencies and educational networking.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

Start thinking about an integrated teaching plan idea that uses your group’s ‘tool’ in a series of 3 lessons. Prepare initial ideas for discussion on Tuesday 3 November (Session 3).</p><p>Your engagement with all aspects of this unit, including the online lecture tasks (CSER MOOC), essay, eportfolio reflections and your approach to the presentation/workshop/lesson planning should reflect the expectations of AQF Level 9 (described below).<br></p><p>The unit has been designed to be challenging at AQF Level 9: Masters Degree (Coursework). This means that all your work on assignments and weekly participation must reflect the appropriate level of thinking. This level of thinking includes being able to reflect critically on theory and professional practice; using your cognitive, technical and creative skills to investigate, analyse and synthesise complex information, problems, concepts and theories related to technology education; apply established theories to different bodies of knowledge or practice to generate and evaluate complex ideas and concepts at an abstract level, and you should be able to justify and interpret theoretical ideas, methodologies, conclusions and professional decisions to specialist (such as other teachers) and non-specialist audiences (such as parents). At this level you will develop the technical and communication skills to design, evaluate, implement, analyse and theorise about developments in technology education that contribute to professional practice or scholarship. It is expected that you will be proactive in drawing on theory related to both pedagogy and technology education. Your submitted assignment work will be judged and marked with AQF Level 9 expectations in mind.</p><p>In terms of your generic skills, this unit aims to help you improve your communication skills as you will be engaging in a lot of written and oral communication; problem-solving and creativity in that you will be thinking of appropriate and creative ways to meet the technology education needs of children; and teamwork in that you will work in groups and teams to present a group assignment, and through your active, collaborative participation during the workshops.  As in almost every unit you undertake in your MTeach, your critical thinking skills will be developed as you will evaluate and critique research. When you start looking for employment, employers are very interested in these generic skills.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

Written literacy and referencing expectations will normally be incorporated into assignment rubrics.</p><p>ADDITIONAL DETAILED ASSESSMENT INFORMATION</p><p><strong>Assignment 1- Weekly online tasks</strong></p><p>In an increasingly digital world, rapid technological change has the potential to impact every aspect of teaching. This is particularly evident in the delivery and assessment of the Western Australian Curriculum: Technologies learning area, Pre-primary to Year 6 and its two distinct, but related, subjects of Design &amp; Technologies, and Digital Technologies. This assignment is underpinned by completion of the nationally accredited University of Adelaide Computer Science Education Research Group (CSER) F-6 Digital Technologies: Foundations MOOC over eight weeks. This MOOC acts as the lecture component of this unit and will provide you with 21 hours of professional learning, plus a certificate of completion mapped to AITSL standards. Completion of the MOOC activities and associated online tasks is designed to develop your background knowledge about concepts and topics in the Technologies curriculum, as well as highlighting practical examples that can be used in the classroom. The LMS discussion board component is designed for you to engage with the content at a more sophisticated level, to help you to become agile thinkers in terms of integrating technologies into the wider curriculum, and to generate a bank of Technology-related teaching ideas that each of you can draw from. The main purpose of this assignment is to develop your knowledge of the Technologies curriculum and associated teaching and assessment strategies.<br></p><p><strong>Part A – MOOC</strong>. Engage with the online lecture content and complete the weekly task. Post the task on the designated Google Community site and MOOC page as instructed. Post a copy of the completed task to the relevant weekly LMS Discussion Forum. Include the suggested year level and curriculum links that relate to your post (2 marks each week).</p><p><strong>Part B –&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Essay</strong> (600 words). (15 marks). Compose a brief essay of 600 words to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of published research into how children learn with technologies and the implications for teaching and learning with technologies (15 Marks). A high standard of academic writing and APA referencing is a requirement to pass this part of the assignment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br></span></p><p><strong>Assignment 2 - Eportfolio</strong><br></p><p>A Digital Professional Portfolio (eportfolio) is a key requirement of the Master of Teaching course. The Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) mandated that all graduates should be in a position to provide evidence that they have met the Graduate Australian Professional Standards for Teachers. Therefore, preservice teachers are required to (a) demonstrate the Graduate Teacher Standards through the successful completion of on-campus assessments and professional experience contexts, and the collation of a digital professional portfolio, and (b) demonstrate impact on student learning as evidenced through the digital professional portfolio and the Graduate Australian Professional Standards. It is expected that the digital professional portfolio will be a resource that you will continue to add to and modify as you progress through the profession.<br></p><p>The purpose of this assignment is to showcase your accomplishment at the graduate level in the area of Technologies education. It will also encourage ongoing reflective practice to help you to continue to grow as a teacher, and to support job applications and career progression. You will have the opportunity to create ‘evidence stories’ against the technology-related Standards, and to polish and finalise your eportfolio.<br></p><p>The eportfolio will be constructed as a website (New Google Sites is recommended) and will be suitable for use during a formal job interview. </p><p>Your eportfolio will provide evidence that you have met the Technologies-related Graduate Australian Professional Standards for Teachers. Standards that are assessed in this unit comprise Graduate Standard 1.2 (a cited academic research rationale that comments on the use of Technologies for student learning and the implications of Technologies for teaching), technology-related Graduate Standards 2.6, 3.4 and 4.5, and evidence of your Personal Learning Network (PLN) under Standards 6.4 and 7.4. </p><p>You will draw from on-campus assessments, lessons taught during past and current professional practicum placements, and experience gained through this unit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Assignment 3 - Research and planning task&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Connected 21st century students need connected 21st century teachers. Connecting locally and globally through social media, or face-to-face, with practicing teachers who routinely integrate technologies will help you ‘tap in’ to an education community that is working to achieve common goals through the sharing of practice, knowledge, innovations and problems. Effective collaboration encourages ongoing observation and feedback, and helps to promote a culture of professional sharing, dialogue, experimentation and constructive critique. Developing your own high quality professional learning culture as part of a personal learning network (PLN), has the potential to enhance student learning outcomes and is an important aspect of your ongoing development as a teacher.</p><p>This assignment is concerned with educational networking, and relates to AITSL Graduate Standards 6.4 and 7.4. The overarching purpose of this assignment is to support the creation of a high quality PLN, extend your knowledge of digital educational tools and to cultivate a professional learning culture within this unit. You will work together to research (by contacting local and international practicing teachers through social media) how technology is being used in the teaching community (7.4), collaborate to disseminate this knowledge through a group presentation, share innovative practice by creating a series of lessons based on the tool, and engage in authentic assessment by providing constructive critique and feedback to peers (via LMS peer marking) on those lessons.</p><p>Specifically, the aim of Part A of this assignment is to locate practicing teachers who currently use technologies to enhance their teaching, and to use these PLN connections to explore how a particular digital tool can be used effectively in the classroom. The aim of Part B is to develop a series of four learning experiences based on what you learned about this tool. An additional aim of Part B, is to provide you with an authentic opportunity to use technologies to assess and provide feedback in a real-world context.</p><p><strong>Part A – Group digital tool research (10 marks) and group presentation (10 marks).&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>Peer feedback provided. Tutor assessed.</strong></i></p><p>The class will be divided equally into four groups, with each group focusing on one of four set topics. Each member of the group is required to use Web 2.0, social media and other means to find teachers who are using the tool in their classroom. This is intended to be predominantly an online research task, but personal contacts can also be included. Please be mindful not to harass any one resource (e.g. TeachMeet). Explain that you are researching for an assignment and use this as a professional opportunity to develop your network.</p><p>Each group will submit a group-generated mind map with an embedded 4-5 minute recorded narration by group members. This mind map and audio narration will highlight key points of the group’s research strategy and how this task impacted each group member’s personal learning network (PLN). This should be uploaded to LMS with a copy of your group’s presentation and demonstration notes. During your presentation/workshop, you do not need to talk about how you conducted your research.</p><p><i>Note: Aspects of this assessment can be added to your eportfolio as part of the PLN requirements under APST 6.4 or 7.4.</i></p><p>Group members combine what they have found into a group presentation (30 minutes) and hands-on workshop (30 minutes) to the whole class, addressing the following points related to the AITSL Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (APSTs) Graduate Standards:</p><p>● How is the tool being used in classrooms at various year levels? Provide actual examples with images if possible/appropriate.</p><p>● What teaching strategies are required for this tool to expand student learning? (2.6)</p><p>● How can this tool be used to engage students? (3.4)</p><p>● What are the safe, responsible and ethical use considerations related to integrating this tool into teaching and learning? (4.5)</p><p>● How can the tool be integrated with Design &amp; Technology to create a holistic learning experience?</p><p>Each group member should play a role in the presentation which should run for around 30 minutes. A further 30 minutes is allocated for a hands-on demonstration of the tool. You can collect resources from my office to help you become familiar with the tool and to plan your demonstration. Please email me prior. The group presentation PowerPoint and demonstration notes only need to be submitted to LMS once by one group member.&nbsp;<br></p><p><i>Note: Elements of this assessment can be added to your eportfolio as part of your entries under a range of graduate standards, such as APST 6.4 or 7.4.<br></i></p><p><strong>Part B – Personal Teaching Plan (10 marks). <i>Peer assessed.</i></strong></p><p>Students create a series of three learning experiences that integrate the tool you researched into a unit of work, at your choice of year level. You need only provide explicit detail of the technology-related lessons.</p><p>The teaching plan overview must demonstrate links to the Western Australian Curriculum: Technologies learning area and its two subjects of Design &amp; Technologies, and Digital Technologies. It should also incorporate the Early Years Learning Framework for Australia (where applicable), the SCSA General Capabilities (where appropriate), and the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Capability.</p><p>The teaching plan must include a suggestion for an assessment task that includes the tool.</p><p><i>Note: This assessment could be added to your eportfolio as part of your entry under APST 2.6 or 3.4</i><br></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
