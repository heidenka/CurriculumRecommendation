It also examines other key relationships between security and globalisation, transnationalism and regionalism, as well as core concepts such as the security dilemma, securitisation and security communities.

The unit explores and distinguishes contending approaches to the study and practice of security, including traditional, national, critical and human security approaches, and examines how different approaches conceive of security referents, threats and challenges and prescribe security providers, responses, methods and policies. It also examines other key relationships between security and globalisation, transnationalism and regionalism, as well as core concepts such as the security dilemma, securitisation and security communities. Contemporary examples and cases are used to interrogate relationships between security theories, policies and practices.<p>Students are able to (1) develop and demonstrate advanced knowledge of core theories, concepts and practices in International Relations; (2) develop and demonstrate an advanced understanding of core methods of inquiry and research in International Relations; (3) develop and demonstrate an advanced understanding of important cross-cutting themes in International Relations; (4) develop and demonstrate advanced professional writing skills for careers in International Relations; (5) develop and demonstrate research competency and advanced analytical skills for careers in International Relations; and (6) develop and demonstrate professional communication and/or cross-cultural and/or behavioural and/or networking skills for careers in International Relations.</p></p></pre></p>

We will explore the following questions: What are ‘security’ and ‘international security’? Who/what are the ‘referent objects’ for security? How do we assess threats to security? Who should respond to those threats? Through what methods should security threats be responded to? As part of this we will overview the IR sub-field of International Security Studies (ISS), and consider the changing nature of conflict and security by examining some conflict data and emerging trends.</p><p><strong>Seminar 2: Traditional Security: Theory and Practice	3 March</strong></p><p>In this seminar we explore ‘traditional’ or conventional approaches to security, which have been grouped by some into a basket as ‘Traditional Security Studies’. These approaches have been dominant in mainstream (Western) academia and have had, and continue to have, a clear impact on the thinking and security policy-making and practice by governments around the world (often captured as ‘national security’). These approaches essentially encompass debates on security between (neo)realists and (neo)liberals regarding the nature of international relations and security, the possibilities for mitigating international insecurity and the security dilemma in the international system, and the best methods through which security can be achieved. These approaches can be seen as largely state-centric, rationalist, and externally-oriented, with war or cooperation between states under conditions of international anarchy as the main subject. Realist approaches, in particular, are heavily focused upon the role of power, military force and alliances in both creating and undermining security, while liberals have focused upon the role of other mechanisms, such as international institutions, democracy, interdependence and free trade, in mitigating insecurity.</p><p><strong>Seminar 3: Critical Security: Theory and Practice	10 March</strong></p><p>Toward the end of the Cold War a group of critical scholars began to gain influence within International Security Studies. This week, we examine this broad ‘Critical Security Studies’ (CSS) approach—which includes various perspectives including from constructivism, feminism, Critical Theory and others—and how it has sought to challenge and undermine the ontological, epistemological and methodological assumptions that underpin the traditional, dominant (and rationalist/positivist) approaches, and in doing so has sought to ‘broaden and deepen security’. As such, we rethink the notions of security and the relationship between the study and practice of security, or the so-called observer and observed, and (re)consider the normative dimensions of security. Finally, we explore the key critical notion of ‘securitisation’ in the study, practice, and politics of international security and how this helps us to understand the social and political construction of security.</p><p><strong>Seminar 4: Human Security: Theory and Practice	17 March</strong></p><p>Emerging largely in the post-Cold War political and intellectual environment, human security is an approach to security analysis and practice that seeks to situate individuals (or sub-state/transnational groups) as the referent objects for security. Yet there are also some interesting internal divisions within human security studies between proponents of ‘broad’, ‘narrow’, threshold-based and other approaches. This week, we explore how human security approaches can been seen as further challenges to ‘traditional’ conceptions and practices of security, which have tended to privilege the security of the abstracted state or international system over the insecurity of ordinary people in their daily lives; in this sense, human security has important but contested links with critical approaches to security, and also contributes to debates over the security-development ‘nexus’. Furthermore, it asks us to question the nature of the security relationship between the state and citizens; where states are not protecting their own citizens, it also raises important questions about the location of the so-called ‘Responsibility to Protect’, including under what circumstances external military intervention to ensure human security might be legitimate.</p><p><strong>Seminar 5: Transnational Security Challenges	24 March</strong></p><p>In this seminar we examine relationships between globalisation and security, including transnational security threats and challenges. There are different aspects to this relationship. For example, environmental change—a phenomena that is global in scope and impact (if uneven)—can be understood to have substantial and multifaceted implications for both human and national security. Similarly, protecting communications, information and critical infrastructure though national cyber security policies is a major concern for governments in the face of our dependency on relatively vulnerable digital technologies. Furthermore, we can consider the security implications of physical trans-border movements, such as of people (both refugees and those associated with illicit movements and trafficking) and weapons (particularly small arms), for new host societies and their wider regional environments and well as for vulnerable groups and individuals. The tools of globalisation have also facilitated the diffusion and networking of violent ideologies, including by groups who practice terrorism. Moreover, there are often close connections between criminally- and politically-motivated transnational networks. As part of this discussion, we also consider the policy challenges of responding to global and transnational security threats and whether national, international and/or other responses are the most appropriate and effective.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Seminar 6: Security in Regional Contexts	31 March</strong></p><p>In this final seminar we extend our discussion from global/transnational security to examine security in regional geo-political contexts. Such regions are usually defined by the proximity of states and societies to one another, such that they are affected by each others’ security-related actions or inactions (including transnational ‘spill-over’ and ‘ungoverned spaces’), and this might be characterised as a ‘regional security complex’. However, regions can also sometimes be characterised by a shared set of values. If there is a shared set of values that promotes cooperation, regions may develop into ‘security communities’, where trust is high and the risk of conflict low. Regions may also develop security governance institutions or other mechanisms to respond to or manage insecurity that may arise. We will evaluate regional security governance responses and challenges, including in contrast to local, national and global mechanisms and responses.</p></p></pre></p>

In POLS5641, your seminar participation is worth 15% of the total grade. This will consist of objective measures as well as a weekly subjective assessment of the level and quality of your participation in the seminar by the unit coordinator. </p><p>To adequately prepare for each seminar, you must read the required texts set for that particular seminar (as listed below) and then locate, print, bring to class, and submit to the unit coordinator one online news item (starting from Seminar 2) from the past week that has direct relevance for the topic/key concepts pertaining to that week’s seminar (e.g. news items from ABC News, BBC News, Al Jazeera, CNN, The Australian, The Guardian pertaining to an international security issue). This will also help us to directly link security theories to contemporary security practices and developments. </p><p>Therefore, your mark will be determined by the objective measures of (i) actual attendance, and (ii) submission of relevant news item at the end of the seminar. Subjectively, the unit coordinator will be looking for evidence of required readings having been done, the linking of your news item to the seminar discussion where appropriate, and the general quality of your contributions to the seminar. If you attend each week but do not actively participate in the discussion, then you will not obtain full seminar participation marks. Small group work will be used each week to facilitate opportunities for every student to participate in discussions and seminar activities.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
