                                    <td>This unit explores the various historical, social, political and international dimensions of contemporary China, whose global rise has caught the world's imagination due to its newly acquired economic and military prowess. The unit is focused on the major issues and policies of the People's Republic of China (PRC), particularly the political economy of its reform and modernisation drive, the country's changing political institutions, expanding civil society and prospects of democratisation. The other components of a 'Greater China' is also examined. Thus, political transformation in Taiwan, Hong Kong and global Chinese diasporas are studied for their interactions with, and impact on, the mainland China. 

Specifically, the teaching and learning of the unit progresses through four integrated topical parts. Part one provides an analytical framework by presenting knowledge of China's pre-1949 political history and the fundamentals of the PRC as a party-state, and by critiquing the various scholarly approaches to the study of China. Part two investigates PRC politics chronologically, from Mao's class struggle and Cultural Revolution to the Hu-Wen regime's soft authoritarianism with more emphasis on social justice and human needs. Part three examines the major political phenomena during the reform era including leadership transition, growth of civil society, issues of minorities (Tibetans and Muslims), foreign policy transformation, social and environmental crises, mass discontent and protest movements, trends of political liberalisation and signs of democratisation. Part four looks at the developments in the 'other Chinas', namely politics of democratisation and unification in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and the social and political implications of the rapid expansion of the overseas Chinese communities.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>This unit explores the various historical, social, political and international dimensions of contemporary China, whose global rise has caught the world’s imagination due to its newly acquired economic, military and soft power prowess. The unit is focused on the major issues and policies of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), particularly the political economy of its reform and modernization drive, the country’s changing political institutions, expanding civil society, and prospects of democratization. The other components of a Greater China will also be examined – thus, political transformation in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and global Chinese diaspora will be studied for their interactions with, and impact on, the mainland China.<p>Specifically, an introductory lecture will present the analytical frameworks by critiquing the various scholarly approaches to the study of China, and the rest of the unit will then progress through five integrated topical themes, each of which will be based on a number of lectures (please check 3. Lecture Program). Theme 1 provides knowledge of China’s pre-1949 political history, discussing the circumstances in which the country became the communist People’s Republic of China, the polity as we know today. Theme 2 investigates the PRC politics chronologically, from Mao’s radical class struggle and Cultural Revolution to the current regime’s populist authoritarianism with more emphasis on sustainable economic growth, nationalist sentiment and diplomatic clout. Theme 3 examines the major political, social, environmental, and ethnic challenges and crises during the reform era, as well as looking for signs of political liberalisation and future democratization.  Theme 4 is focused on China’s evolving international relations, looking into the party-state’s changing foreign policy, its passionate pursuit of soft power and the mounting challenges to the state’s most important bilateral relations, ie, Sino-US relations. Theme 5 looks at the developments in the “other Chinas”, namely politics of democratization and unification in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and the social and political implications of the rapid expansion of the overseas Chinese communities worldwide. The lecture series will conclude with a grand historical and conceptual assessment of the politics in Greater China. </p><p>Students are expected to acquire historical and conceptual comprehension of the political developments in Greater China, particularly the mainland, and see the sources of the country’s success and inherent weakness in the age of globalization. This unit will also complement the study of comparative politics, international relations in East Asia, democratization in Asia, Asian societies and Australia’s foreign policy. Ultimately, to understand China, an emerging global power and the largest trade partner of Australia, is important to students in Australia because what happens in China and/or between China and Australia may provide both great opportunities and challenges to their future careers. <br></p><br></p></pre></p>
