                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Students should start working on the unit as soon as possible, as it is an ASTRONOMY unit, and the skies are most likely clear at the start of semester.   Hence project work commences immediately in week 1. </p><p>Specifically, in this unit as part of the Project (assessment item A2) students will be using an optical telescope, accessed via the internet, to conduct optical-astronomy photometry observations of stellar clusters to create Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams.  These observations can only be performed when (a) it is dark (i.e. at night and away from the Moon),  (b) when the weather is clear, and (c) when the telescope and observatory is operating correctly.  The weather is most likely to be clear very early in semester.  Therefore it is crucial that students commence taking observations with the SPIRIT telescopes as soon as possible after receiving initial training.  That training will be given during the Astro-Lunch Forum (called "Lab" on CAS) in week 1.  </p><p>Coursework that directly supports the project is also covered at the start of semester, so it is very important that students do not fall behind.</p><p>The telescope(s) that you will be using are delicate instruments.  Every effort is made to have them work as reliably as possible, but like any delicate equipment, they are subject to faults that interrupt or stop observations for a day or two.  Students should EXPECT such faults to occur without warning, and to factor this into their observation planning by commencing observations as soon as possible.  Students are warned NOT to leave taking their observations to close to the project submission deadlines.  Simply leaving your observing until close to a deadline, and then complaining of bad weather, or minor telescope faults and so forth, will NOT be considered sufficient grounds to receive an extension on the project submission deadlines. </p><p>In this unit students have the opportunity to extend the project to investigate an area of astrophysics that really interests them, with some guidance from staff, and to write up their work in the form of a professional scientific manuscript (paper).  This is assessed in the two components of the Assignment (assessment item A3).   Students are encouraged to begin, early in semester, exploring and thinking about what they want to do, giving themselves the greatest time to develop their studies, and to write the manuscript. Ungraded formative-feedback on a student's progress and work on the assignment will be given intermittently through the semester, and/or at a student's request.</p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit is delivered in a "flipped classroom" mode as follows.  Students attend one two-hour workshop a week, to which they have been assigned.  They are expected to prepare for the workshop by watching pre-recorded videos, reading notes, and possibly completing on-line practice quizzes.  At the start of the workshop students complete a short quiz that contributes to their final assessment (part of assessment item 1 below).    The answers to the quiz are then discussed during the workshop under the guidance of the teacher, followed by a deeper discussion on some aspects of the material, and/or problems presented during the workshop.  </p><p>After the workshops, students should reflect on what was covered during the workshop and complete the supplied worksheets (with solutions).  There are three 45-minunte mid-semester tests (part of assessment item 1), during which students are asked to problem solve, based on the solved problems supplied in the worksheets on LMS.   </p><p>The final exam (part of assessment item 1) will include quiz-like questions, worksheet type problems to solve, and extended-answer questions based on the material covered during the workshops.  </p><p>In addition to the workshops, there is a weekly 3-hour "Astro-Lunch Forum".  This is your opportunity to ask questions of staff or fellow students on the coursework and worksheets, to work on the problem sheets in a collegial environment,  to meet with a project demonstrator to review your progress on the project, and work on your data analysis and observation planning, and to continue your work on the Assignment with input from those around.  It is also your opportunity to eat lunch! Talks and tests are occasionally scheduled during the Astro-Lunch Forum. (See the Unit Schedule).</p><p>The teaching and learning strategy in this unit is clearly based on Bloom's Revised Taxonomy of Educational Objectives [1], which categorizes learning processes into six levels.  Going from the lowest to highest-order levels, they are:</p><p>&nbsp; 1. Remembering  (lowest-level learning)</p><p>&nbsp; 2. Understanding </p><p>&nbsp; 3. Applying</p><p>&nbsp; 4. Analysing</p><p>&nbsp; 5. Evaluating</p><p>&nbsp; 6. Creating (highest-level learning)</p><p>There are three assessment items in the unit to assess how well a student achieves each of those learning levels, namely</p><p>&nbsp; A1. Quizzes, Tests and Exam</p><p>&nbsp; A2. Project: stellar-cluster photometry</p><p>&nbsp; A3. Assignment: individual research and scientific paper</p><p>By preparing for and completing the in-class Quizzes, students will be developing their low-level learning, namely Remembering and Understanding.  By solving the problems on the supplied worksheets, and comparing their answers to the worked solutions, and then completing the two mid-semester Tests, students are developing their ability to Apply their knowledge and Analyse (mid-level learning) results.  By participating in the workshops and completing the Project, students are developing their ability to Analyse and Evaluate (higher-level learning).  The final Exam will assess students at all the levels of learning up to Evaluating.  By completing the Assignment students will be developing their ability to Create - the highest-level of learning. &nbsp;</p><p>[1] Bloom's Revised Taxonomy of Educational Objectives is described in the video: <a href='https://youtu.be/Qfp3x_qx5IM' target='_blank' >https://youtu.be/Qfp3x_qx5IM</a></p></p></pre></p>

                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
