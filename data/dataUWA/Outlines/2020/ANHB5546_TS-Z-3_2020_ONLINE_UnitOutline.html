Students will gain an understanding of the importance of evidence based medical and dental practice and that a relationship between medical and dental disciplines is important for the use of oral appliances for treating sleep-disordered breathing.  Students will develop basic skills in evaluating the upper airway and the requirements for determining the suitability for oral appliance therapy. The role and specific tasks relevant to a comprehensive dental examination prior to implementing oral appliance therapy will be explained. Evidence-based protocols and current treatment paradigms will be explored in detail and the student will complete the course with the skills to make informed treatment choices for patients.  A range of oral appliances will be explored and current evidence-based treatment protocols will be presented in a cohesive form structured against the stepwise treatment of patients, including pre-treatment, monitoring and medical liaison. Guidelines for the scope and extent of dentist participation in treatment of sleep-disordered breathing will be presented as will the basic legal requirements of the dentist. At the completion of the unit students will have the skills to select appropriate appliance options for patients and have a comprehensive understanding of their indications and contraindications for treatment.</td>

Students will gain an understanding of the importance of evidence based medical and dental practice and that a relationship between medical and dental disciplines is important for the use of oral appliances for treating sleep-disordered breathing.  Students will develop basic skills in evaluating the upper airway and the requirements for determining the suitability for oral appliance therapy. The role and specific tasks relevant to a comprehensive dental examination prior to implementing oral appliance therapy will be explained. Evidence-based protocols and current treatment paradigms will be explored in detail and the student will complete the course with the skills to make informed treatment choices for patients.  A range of oral appliances will be explored and current evidence-based treatment protocols will be presented in a cohesive form structured against the stepwise treatment of patients, including pre-treatment, monitoring and medical liaison. Guidelines for the scope and extent of dentist participation in treatment of sleep-disordered breathing will be presented as will the basic legal requirements of the dentist. At the completion of the unit students will have the skills to select appropriate appliance options for patients and have a comprehensive understanding of their indications and contraindications for treatment.</p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>

It consists of six separate modules. You are able to work through each module and begin the next module at your own pace throughout the duration of the semester. At the end of each module you must complete an online quiz and/or short written assessment before you can move on to the next module. All quizzes and the final exam are accessed via links in Blackboard. Most module quiz scores will be available to you immediately after completing each quiz. Written assessment marks may take longer to receive due to manual marking by a unit coordinator. Final exam marks will not be available until the release of your final grade through the University. It is recommended that students work through the unit at a pace of 1 module per fortnight if doing only one unit or 1 module every week if doing two units in a semester.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
