The core focus is on what it means to do development, in a variety of different contexts, and what knowledge and skills a development practitioner needs to have to address real challenges encountered in the field. It introduces students to key actors in international development and the working cultures of large development institutions (e.g. World Bank, UN organisations; non-government development agencies; aid/relief organisations; aid celebrities, and development academics. This exploration is set against theoretical perspectives that inform values, assumptions, rationales and ethics underpinning development practice. Students critically reflect on their own position in development and develop self-reflexive, technical and communication skills required for professionals working in international development, regional planning, and humanitarian aid.</td>

The core focus is on what it means to do development, in a variety of different contexts, and what knowledge and skills a development practitioner needs to have to address real challenges encountered in the field. It introduces students to key actors in international development and the working cultures of large development institutions (e.g. World Bank, UN organisations; non-government development agencies; aid/relief organisations; aid celebrities, and development academics. This exploration is set against theoretical perspectives that inform values, assumptions, rationales and ethics underpinning development practice. Students critically reflect on their own position in development and develop self-reflexive, technical and communication skills required for professionals working in international development, regional planning, and humanitarian aid.</p></p></pre></p>

Explain what theoretical insights, values, emotions (hopes and fears), and identity (subjectivity) you bring to the field of international development. Explain any prior experience that may shape your current thinking and positionality. Describe how you would like to engage in development practice in the future, either through academia, a career in a grassroots organization, an NGO, or a large-scale development institution and how you want to avoid typical pitfalls. If you don’t have career plans in international development, describe how you could see yourself contributing to core missions of development through other possible entry points, for instance volunteer work in your own country or abroad, or becoming a more socially engaged urban planner. The objective is to process the various readings and discussions in a self-reflexive manner. It is essential that you have done all assigned readings for the unit and all reading & reflection logs. You also want to incorporate notes from class that you have taken during workshop discussions and relevant learning experience from engaging with the development blogs.  This essay is due 1 November at 23:59pm, on LMS, using Turnitin. Length: 2,800-3,000 words (do NOT exceed the word limit!) Format: 12 point, Times New Roman font, 1.5 spaced, with 2cm margins on A4 paper  Structure and sections of the essay/critical review: 1.	The meaning of development practice to date, based on theories and case studies; 2.	Your positionality as an actor of development practice, including prior experience; 3.	Your aspirations and concrete strategies for overcoming pitfalls and challenges; 4.	Your hopes and fears, skills and struggles, regarding development practice.  Marking criteria: 1.

This first week provides a basic introduction to practice and practitioners in international development. Who are these practitioners? What do they do? What skills do they have? What challenges do they encounter? What solutions exist when we engage in development practice and which of these seem to work? We will take a first glimpse at knowledge practices and ‘travelling rationalities’ of a variety of actors involved in development practice and at specific strategies to navigate dilemmas in community development. Moreover, we will test emerging insights into power dynamics between different development actors through an in-class simulation regarding the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

In the second week, we explore two key actors in international development – the World Bank and the world of consultants through smaller agencies. We critically assess the evolution of the ‘expert’ in international development, including gender ‘experts’. We explore distinct working cultures and evaluate expert knowledge, meaning which knowledge counts in particular institutional settings, and how power relations and expectations between donors and consultants shape development practice.

This week is devoted to the lives and lifestyles of expatriates and development/aid workers, including humanitarian work. We examine themes like mobility, temporality, privilege, transculturalism, and whiteness, certain ways of doing and being in the development bubble. We contrast the accounts from Aidland, applied predominantly to western types of development engagements, with experiences of local aid workers in disaster recovery.

The ‘development bubble’ is not only full of contradictions and ethical dilemmas but also prone to risky behaviour and dangerous situations, within and beyond contexts of crisis. During this week, we explore how development/aid/humanitarian workers deal with danger, consciously and unconsciously, and how danger shapes practice. We also examine the ‘work in crisis’ rhetoric, how it governs the lived experiences of the ‘development persona’, and how it produces institutionalised sets of values and distinct techniques of governmentality.

During this week, we tackle new faces and fantasies is the world of international development, shifting our attention to the role of celebrities (e.g. Bono, Madonna, and Angelina Jolie, but also Jeffrey Sachs and Paul Farmer) in creating what we may want to call ‘hip’ development. We explore the potentially problematic linkage between aid in Africa and consumption in the North, celebrity humanitarianism among largely female volunteer tourists, and the anti-politics in the Millennium Village Project.

This week takes on a different tone. Having unpacked some of the new as well as persistent power imbalances in development practice and the lives of development/aid/humanitarian workers, we now want to explore what it takes to adopt better, more ethical, more committed, more successful practices across a range of professional contexts. This includes the recognition of the key role of values, ethics, emotions, subjectivities, and insecurities in efforts to be socially engaged and danger in the everyday lives of development workers and development subjects, many of which often remain hidden.

(Part I)

This week opens doors to alternative theoretical perspectives on development, drawing from post-colonialism and post-development. We explore development as a project of both hope and political engagement, inspired by ideals of greater social justice and care. Let’s examine how we position ourselves as voices of authority or engage in transnational solidarity activism.

A log is a one-page (11pt Times New Roman, single spaced) précis and critical digestion of each paper. I am not interested (and you won’t benefit) from summaries or slightly modified abstracts. The logs are your reaction to the paper, based on careful reading and reflective and critical thinking. </p><p>Each reading log should start with the full name of all authors and their affiliations (who are they?) – not counted toward the one page –  and then address the following four parts (all 4):</p><p>•	What is the core message/argument of the paper? What is/are the author(s) trying to say?</p><p>•	What are the strengths and limitations of the paper (i.e. is it well argued, or are there gaps or weaknesses)? What do you like, and what leaves you confused?</p><p>•	How does the article affect you? Does it trigger new insights, does it make you feel angry, depressed, does it inspire you, does it challenge you or your way of thinking to the core?</p><p>•	What are the key ideas or questions that you would like to discuss or clarify as part of a discussion in class? This is particularly important for the discussants and in preparation for interacting with our guest speakers. </p><p>Reading &amp; reflection logs need to be submitted to the Discussion Board (Forum) on LMS, no later than 6pm Sundays before class! The discussion leader for individual articles will read over your reading log and incorporate ideas for class discussion from your suggestions. They will also assess how well the four bullet points above are addressed in each log.</p><p>Marking criteria (17 pts per article) :</p><p>Evidence of clear understanding of the arguments, theories, methods, and limitations of the paper, as presented by the author(s) (8pts);</p><p>Ability to raise critical questions, spot ambiguities or novel ideas, and state emotions (6 pts);</p><p>Quality of the summary: good grammar, eloquent writing style, perfect spelling (3 pts). <br></p><p>b)	Development blogging/tweeting and debate (20% of the final marks for the unit)</p><p>Blogging and tweeting have enhanced the visibility of voices in international development on the internet and social media. In this assessment, you are asked to follow ONE blog and ONE hashtag from the list below over the course of the trimester, attempt to actively engage in some debates of your choice (either via posting a blog/tweet or commenting on it), reflect on your virtual encounters, and share your experience with your peers in class.</p><p>Over the course of ~ 6 weeks (from 15 September 2020 onward), you will individually follow and participate in one blog and one hashtag. We will ensure that you all follow different debates. Then, in teams of two, reflect on the following five bullets and prepare a 20min long presentation of your respective experiences for presentation in our online workshop the last day of class (20 October). I will provide more details before the Study Break (Week 40). Your team member will function as peer-evaluator for your blogging and tweeting throughout the ~6 weeks. </p><p>•	Who writes/blogs/tweets and on what themes? Consider gender, profession, status, organization, age, country of residence and/or origin;</p><p>•	Whose voices are represented and whose are missing? How global is the blog/tweet?</p><p>•	What are the key messages? What is the tone? What is the evidence provided?</p><p>•	Which fields are targeted? Development practice, expat lifestyles, policy advice, theory…</p><p>•	How does active participation in a blog and tweet of your choice shape your insights into development practice and enhance reflective learning processes?</p><p>Available blogs to choose from (or you may identify suitable other ones)</p><p>ACFID <a href='https://acfid.asn.au/acfid-blog' target='_blank' >https://acfid.asn.au/acfid-blog</a></p><p>AfID <a href='https://www.afid.org.uk/volunteers?blogs=1' target='_blank' >https://www.afid.org.uk/volunteers?blogs=1</a></p><p>AidData <a href='http://aiddata.org/blog' target='_blank' >http://aiddata.org/blog</a></p><p>Aid for Aid Workers <a href='http://www.aidforaidworkers.com/' target='_blank' >http://www.aidforaidworkers.com/</a></p><p>Aidnography <a href='http://aidnography.blogspot.com.au/' target='_blank' >http://aidnography.blogspot.com.au/</a></p><p>Aid Worker Voices <a href='https://blogs.elon.edu/aidworkervoices/' target='_blank' >https://blogs.elon.edu/aidworkervoices/</a></p><p>Global Voices <a href='http://globalvoicesonline.org/' target='_blank' >http://globalvoicesonline.org/</a></p><p>Chis Blattman <a href='https://chrisblattman.com/' target='_blank' >https://chrisblattman.com/</a></p><p>CIPE Development <a href='http://www.cipe.org/blog/' target='_blank' >http://www.cipe.org/blog/</a></p><p>Concern Worldwide <a href='https://blog.concern.net/topic/aid-worker' target='_blank' >https://blog.concern.net/topic/aid-worker</a></p><p>Development in Action <a href='http://www.developmentinaction.org/the-dia-blog/' target='_blank' >http://www.developmentinaction.org/the-dia-blog/</a></p><p>DevPolicy <a href='http://devpolicy.org/' target='_blank' >http://devpolicy.org/</a></p><p>From Poverty to Power oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/</p><p>Goats and Soda <a href='https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/502900047/development' target='_blank' >https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/502900047/development</a></p><p>Ground Reality <a href='http://devinder-sharma.blogspot.com.au/' target='_blank' >http://devinder-sharma.blogspot.com.au/</a></p><p>Humanicontrarian <a href='https://www.humanicontrarian.com/' target='_blank' >https://www.humanicontrarian.com/</a></p><p>Humanitarian Jobs <a href='https://humanitarianjobs.wordpress.com/' target='_blank' >https://humanitarianjobs.wordpress.com/</a></p><p>Interaction <a href='https://www.interaction.org/newsroom/blog' target='_blank' >https://www.interaction.org/newsroom/blog</a></p><p>International Impact Evaluation <a href='http://blogs.3ieimpact.org/' target='_blank' >http://blogs.3ieimpact.org/</a></p><p>Missing in the Mission <a href='https://missinginthemission.com/' target='_blank' >https://missinginthemission.com/</a></p><p>The Secret Aid Worker <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/series/the-secret-aid-worker' target='_blank' >https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/series/the-secret-aid-worker</a></p><p>Hashtags on Twitter related to development practice (and you may find others!):</p><p>#aidworkers</p><p>#aidland</p><p>#aidtoo</p><p>#humanitarian</p><p>#internationalaid</p><p>#develoment</p><p>#post-development</p><p>#philantrocapitalism</p><p>#expatlife</p><p>#Expats</p><p>#OpenUNDP</p><p>#Developmentsector</p><p>#postcolonial</p><p>Marking criteria:</p><p>1.

Presentation in class on your blogging experience, addressing the five bullets listed above with reference to ONE blog, and engaging in a collective debate on the value of blogging for development (75pts).</p><p>Textbook and Readings</p><p>There is no set textbook for this unit.  However, the unit does involve close reading of 18 scholarly papers over the course of the trimester. Completing these readings forms a core part of the assessment. Readings will be provided via LMS. </p><p>It is essential that you complete all readings BEFORE the designated class; they form the basis of fruitful discussions and debates as well as the core material for your critical essay.</p><p>Details of Assessments	</p><p>All assessments need to be submitted on time! See penalty for late submission on p. 11.</p><p>All assessments will add up to 1,000 points you can gain in this unit. The percentage for your final mark is derived from your accumulated points toward the overall total. <br></p><p><br></p><p>Assignment Submission Requirements</p><p>Submission Details and Late Penalties </p><p>Submit your written assignment (critical essay) on the due date, on time, through the LMS portal. Your assignment must be uploaded as .doc, .docx file. </p><p>In accordance with UWA’s assessment policy, a penalty of 5% of the possible mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays), after which the assigned work is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due. For example, if you submit an assessment item late by three days, and it was scored a mark of 45 out of 50, you would receive an actual mark of 37.5 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day as a penalty). </p><p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached. The same rule applies for an assessment under the required word range.</p><p>If you believe you will have trouble submitting before the deadline due to reasons beyond your control, please apply for Special Consideration through the Faculty of Science (personal reasons or illness). If you are experiencing difficulties specific to the academic requirements of the assignment, please make an appointment to see the unit co-ordinator.</p><p>Extensions (Special Consideration) </p><p>Special Consideration relates to any event or condition which may reasonably have affected your ability to complete an assessment on time (e.g. illness). Full details of the University policy on Special Consideration are provided at <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/title' target='_blank' >http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/title</a></p><p>If you experience any conditions that may affect your academic performance, it is vital that you take the initiative to alert the appropriate people proactively. Teaching staff are unable to provide extensions or any other form of compensation directly to students. This can only occur once you submit your application form and supporting documentation to your Faculty’s Student Office. Information about this procedure is provided on <a href='https://ipoint.uwa.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/68/~/special-consideration-explained' target='_blank' >https://ipoint.uwa.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/68/~/special-consideration-explained</a>. The full policy and information on applying for special consideration is available at <a href='http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/course/exams/consideration' target='_blank' >http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/course/exams/consideration</a></p><p>The Faculty Office will assess the claim and advise relevant staff as to the appropriate forms of action. This process preserves the anonymity of students and ensures that a fair and accountable system of dealing with all Special Consideration claims is adhered to.</p><p>It is essential to act promptly in these cases. All Special Consideration forms must be submitted to the Faculty Office as early as possible to allow appropriate action to be taken. Applications for special consideration must be submitted no later than three University working days after the date on which the relevant work for assessment was due.</p><p><br></p><p>Academic Misconduct</p><p>Students must not engage in academic misconduct. This includes, but is not limited to cheating, or attempting to cheat, through:</p><p>•	Collusion</p><p>•	Inappropriate collaboration</p><p>•	Plagiarism</p><p>•	Misrepresenting or fabricating data or results or other assessable work</p><p>•	Inappropriate electronic data sourcing/collection</p><p>•	Breaching rules specified for the conduct of examinations in a way that may compromise or defeat the purposes of assessment.</p><p>All forms of academic misconduct are condemned by the University as unacceptable behaviour. The Faculty’s policy is to ensure that no student profits from such behaviour. Generally a failure will be recorded for the subject in which the cheating has occurred. Serious cases shall be referred to the University’s Board of Discipline. All students should note that cases of copying are automatically reported to the Dean and documentary evidence along with associated correspondence is placed on the student’s permanent record. Refer to the Ethical Scholarship, Academic Literacy and Academic Misconduct policy.</p><p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p><p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding academic conduct and ethical scholarship at UWA.</p><p>More information about academic misconduct at UWA is available at:</p><p><a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21' target='_blank' >http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21</a></p><p>Note that all work submitted via LMS is automatically checked using anti-plagiarism package 'Turnitin'.</p><p><br></p><p>Appeals: Regulations for student conduct and discipline</p><p>Full regulations governing student appeal procedures, see here: </p><p><a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/regulations/student-conduct/appeals' target='_blank' >http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/regulations/student-conduct/appeals</a></p><p>Charter of student rights and responsibilities</p><p>See: <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07/132' target='_blank' >http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07/132</a></p><p><br></p><p>Student Complaints Protocol</p><p>The Department of Geography and Planning operates a carefully designed protocol with respect to student complaints. These apply to the delivery of any unit with the prefix GEOG or PLNG. All matters are followed up, whether these are made in person, via email or in writing. Strict confidentiality and anonymity is applied at all stages. </p><p>Student complaints relating to administration, teaching, supervision or the conduct of either staff or students should be directed to the relevant Head of Teaching and Learning within the Department. Student complaints relating to any other matter should be directed to the Responsible Officer as detailed at <a href='https://www.web.uwa.edu.au/university/complaints/students/complaint-policy-and-procedures' target='_blank' >https://www.web.uwa.edu.au/university/complaints/students/complaint-policy-and-procedures</a></p><p>The Departmental Heads of Teaching and Learning are currently Dr Sarah Prout Quicke (sarah.proutquicke@uwa.edu.au) for undergraduate units and Dr Linda Robson (linda.robson@uwa.edu.au) for postgraduate units. In the event that the complaint involves either Head of Teaching and Learning, the complaint should be directed to the other Head. </p><p>Any complaint from a student will be acknowledged in writing within 2 working days of receipt. </p><p>Complaints received by the Head of Teaching and Learning will be followed up by an invitation to the student to meet with the relevant Head of Teaching and Learning, together with the Head of Department (currently Dr Julian Clifton). This discussion will be an opportunity to explore the background to the complaint and discuss it in more detail, not to determine the validity of the complaint. The student is welcome to bring along a friend or other supporting individual if s/he wishes. Staff may take notes during this meeting but these records will be strictly confidential and not divulged to anyone outside the meeting.</p><p>The Head of Department and the Head of Teaching and Learning will then hold a separate meeting with the member of staff identified within the complaint. This will explore the staff perspective on the complaint. The identity of the complainant will not be revealed, nor will any material be used which could identify the complainant. </p><p>Both of the above meetings will be held within 10 working days of acknowledging the complaint.</p><p>Within five working days of the above, the Head of Department and the Head of Teaching and Learning will reach a decision on the complaint and communicate this via email to the student and member of staff involved. The student retains the right to appeal this decision. </p><p>Further information on the official complaint procedure is available at <a href='https://www.web.uwa.edu.au/university/complaints/students/submit' target='_blank' >https://www.web.uwa.edu.au/university/complaints/students/submit</a></p><p><br></p><p>Useful Contacts</p><p>Student Guild</p><p>The Guild represents all students enrolled at UWA and can help you in a number of ways.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
