                                    <td>One of the major environmental and social challenges facing humanity is the rapid growth of global cities in fragile ecological settings, particularly those in coastal areas. This unit therefore focuses on the development of urban environments and their relationship to both society and the natural context within which they are found, with the coastal context providing a unifying theme. The processes being examined within the unit are the essential drivers of globalisation, including migration, economic development, resource usage and sustainability. Case studies involve cities at an international scale, including both the developed and developing world, in order to provide detailed comparison and identification of the contrasting outcomes of urbanisation for human societies. This reflects the expertise of the teaching staff who have undertaken work in Asia, Latin America, Europe and the USA in addition to Australia. This unit therefore specifically and directly addresses globalised and culturally diverse environments within which graduates will be living and working.

The unit is designed to encourage reflective thinking and participatory activity on behalf of all students. Through a strong and consistent process of using examples and case studies to illustrate and amplify issues, coupled with a high priority on fieldwork and out of class activities, this pedagogical approach to active learning achieves the learning outcomes while also providing a high quality learning experience for all student backgrounds.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>For the first time in history, more than half of world’s population now live in urban areas. Many of the world’s largest and most rapidly growing cities are found in coastal areas which are subject to particular hazards including flooding and the effects of sea level rise. This generates a host of challenges in terms of planning and managing the social, economic and environmental impacts associated with coastal cities. </p><p>This unit focuses on how we can plan for sustainable and resilient urban growth in coastal areas. It begins by examining the dynamic physical nature of coastal environments. It then explores how processes of migration, development and globalization result in large concentrations of human settlement in these coastal areas. The final theme of the unit turns to examine the impacts of increasing human presence in coastal environments, and evaluates strategies for effectively managing these human-environment interactions at the coast, into the future. </p><p>Case studies from Australia and overseas will be used to illustrate the interaction between society and environment on the coast. There is a strong emphasis on practical work and fieldwork throughout this unit which will facilitate a greater understanding of how to collect, analyse and interpret information essential for long term planning. </p><p>Goal:</p><p>This unit will provide students with an in-depth understanding of the relationship between human settlements and coastal environments and will enable them to engage with the processes of evidence-based policy making for sustainable development.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>In accordance with UWA’s policy on lecture capture all lectures* in enabled venues will be recorded and made available to stream and download by enrolled students via the Lecture Capture System (LCS) for the duration of the unit (including Supplementary and Deferred Examinations period).

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit includes a mix of keynote lectures in the first 7 weeks of semester, and weekly skill-based and hands-on tutorial sessions (referred to interchangeably as ‘laboratory sessions or ‘labs’) throughout semester. A week 9 weekend fieldtrip serves as a pivotal learning experience within the unit, and forms the basis for all labs following the study break (week 8 onwards). </p><p>The unit focuses on the development of core geographical concepts, and technical skills, through an examination of the physical and human interactions that shape coastal cities. While the lecture content will include global comparisons, the lab sessions and fieldtrip will focus primarily on Perth so that you can ground your knowledge and understanding, and develop technical skills, in a local context. The unit places a significant emphasis on fieldwork, with a large portion of the unit focused on students working in groups to collect, analyse and present geographical and planning data related to coastal cities during, and subsequent to, the fieldtrip. </p><p>The labs are a critical component of the unit, and are aimed at equipping you with a range of critical thinking and technical skills that will be foundational to completing your lab portfolio and your fieldwork assessment (worth a combined total of 80% of your marks for this unit). Because these labs are critical to completing your assessments, attendance is compulsory. Absences due to illness or personal difficulties should be discussed with your tutor, preferably prior to the tutorial that will be missed (if not, as soon as practicable afterward). If you miss a lab, it will be your responsibility to catch up on content missed from classmates. Attendance at labs will be taken and attendance records will be used as part of a matrix that determines your final grade on the fieldwork assessment.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>In the first 8 weeks of the unit, there are two 45-minute lectures on Tuesdays during most weeks (the Unit Guide - available for download on the LMS landing page for GEOG1103 - provides more details regarding exact dates) and one two-hour weekly tutorial (or 'laboratory'), which follows on from, and relates to the lecture content for that week. There is also one day-long fieldtrip on the weekend of May 2nd and 3rd. Following the fieldtrip, the focus of the unit turns to the lab classes which are designed to step you through your fieldwork data analysis. Attendance at tutorial classes across semester, and the fieldtrip, is mandatory as work completed during these activities constitutes 80% of the overall mark for this unit. Attendance at lectures is strongly encouraged given the close link between lecture and lab content. That is, in order to successfully complete your lab work, you will need to be familiar with the lecture content.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
