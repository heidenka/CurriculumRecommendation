Welcome to MGMT5608 Entrepreneurship and Innovation. From an academic perspective, entrepreneurship and innovation are complex areas of investigation with substantial debate over their definition and scope. From a practical perspective, entrepreneurship deals with the process of developing new business ventures and promoting growth and innovation in existing firms. Innovation is not just about new technology, but also about doing things better to enhance value to customers, employees and shareholders.
Successful entrepreneurship requires more than merely luck and money. It is a cohesive process of planning, idea development, creativity and risk taking. The main reasons for studying entrepreneurship at postgraduate level are to create entrepreneurial awareness, to develop analytical and creative skills, and to encourage the self-development of students into entrepreneurial business owners or employees. The study of entrepreneurship and innovation has grown significantly throughout the world over recent decades, and is now one of the most popular subjects within leading business schools.
Entrepreneurship is frequently associated with innovation. For example, entrepreneurs have been identified within society as the drivers of ‘creative destruction’, frequently leading radical changes within business markets through the introduction of innovations. However, while innovation is often associated with entrepreneurs, it remains a separate concept with its own dynamics. Innovations can involve radical or evolutionary changes and may or may not involve technology. Within business, innovation is usually associated with product or process technologies that serve to add value or lower costs. Innovation can also involve enhancements to the way a business system is structured, work places are designed, markets are accessed or company finances are managed. Innovators can be equally diverse and those who can blend innovation together with entrepreneurship are likely to profoundly shape the future of their industries.


Unit goals:

This unit aims to give students an overview of the theory, practice and context of entrepreneurship and innovation at both the industry and firm level. Students will be provided with a foundation of ideas and understandings that are designed to shape their thinking and behaviour so as to appreciate the role of entrepreneurship and innovation in modern economies, and to recognise their own abilities in this regard.

As a postgraduate unit it is anticipated that students will gain a better understanding of their own entrepreneurial capacity and recognise that enterprising behaviour can be found in all people regardless of age, gender, ethnicity or socio-economic background. Like leadership, entrepreneurship is an outcome of individual characteristics and environmental context. It is doubtful that entrepreneurship and innovation can be taught to students as specific skills that can be adopted and then applied. However, we believe that it is possible to unlock the creativity and ingenuity in people by exposing them to the lessons of how others have achieved success, and acquiring new tools and conceptual frameworks.

This unit is primarily based on a process and action-oriented approach. Students and would-be entrepreneurs effectively learn only if they take part in the process, and evidence shows that "practice by doing" induces the highest retention rate. Therefore, the course will include a mix of lectures, case studies, entrepreneur testimonies, and a comprehensive business plan development.

It is hoped that students who undertake this unit will find it enjoyable, challenging and intellectually stimulating. The focus of learning within the unit will be upon investigation and analysis, making use of case studies, small group discussion and reporting. Lectures will be held each week to provide a structural framework, however, there will be a strong emphasis placed upon group learning and student participation. The most effective learning takes place when students are required to apply their learning or teach others.</p></pre></p>

More formally, the University regulations state that ‘to complete a course or unit students shall attend prescribed classes, lectures, seminars and tutorials’. Where a student, due to exceptional circumstances, is unable to attend a scheduled class, they are required to obtain prior approval of the unit coordinator to be absent from that class. Any student absent from class without having had such absence approved by the unit coordinator may be referred to the faculty for advice and may be required to withdraw from the unit.</p></pre></p>

The EndNote software package is a really good system for building up a database of references. Not everyone will want to invest the time in using this system but you should consider it if you intend to build up resource materials or plan to undertake extensive research in a particular area. The library staff have also developed a tutoring package: ‘A Quick Guide to Using EndNote’ which provides the basics for using EndNote with an essay <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote' target='_blank' >http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote</a></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>

                    <p>If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend</li>

                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
