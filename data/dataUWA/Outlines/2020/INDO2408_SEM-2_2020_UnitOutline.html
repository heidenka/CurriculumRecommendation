It is designed to expand students' speaking, reading and writing skills through exposure to film, specialist texts and popular literature. Areas covered in the unit include literary, journalistic and academic Indonesia. Students read a major novel in Indonesian as well as study Indonesian films in detail. The exposure to Indonesian popular media provides students with a valuable window into contemporary language use and contemporary youth culture. Central to the unit is a research project using Indonesian language materials, culminating in an extended academic essay in Indonesian on a contemporary social, cultural or political issue. An in-depth look at a popular film provides a valuable window into contemporary language use and contemporary youth culture. The film also provides a springboard into several issues and debates that are explored in class. Students are able to achieve 'vocational proficiency' or Level 4 of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (Elaine Wylie and D. E. Ingram, Griffith University, 1995).</td>

This unit follows on from INDO3407 Indonesian 7 and is the most advanced Indonesian language unit taught at UWA. It is designed to expand students' speaking, reading and writing skills through exposure to films, specialist texts and popular literature. Areas covered in the unit include literary, journalistic and academic Indonesian. Students read a major novel in Indonesian as well as study Indonesian films in detail. The exposure to Indonesian popular media provides students with a valuable window into contemporary language use and contemporary youth culture. Central to the unit is a research project using Indonesian language materials, culminating in an extended academic essay in Indonesian on a contemporary social, cultural or political issue. An in-depth look at a popular film provides a valuable window into contemporary language use and contemporary youth culture. The film also provides a springboard into several issues and debates that are explored in class. Students are able to achieve 'vocational proficiency' or Level 4 of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (Elaine Wylie and D. E. Ingram, Griffith University, 1995).</p></p></pre></p>

However, this semester we use the online model with speaking, listening, viewing, reading comprehension, and writing activities.</p><p><i>Learning activities and purpose</i></p><p>In this unit you have three main tasks. One is to read and discuss Saman, a popular Indonesian novel. The second is to watch and discuss Indonesian films. The third is to do a research project using Indonesian language materials, culminating in a research essay and presentation in Indonesian on a contemporary social, cultural or political issue. </p><p>As a contemporary Indonesian work, Saman will expose you to a mixture of Indonesian writing styles. Reading and discussing the book will also expand your vocabulary and develop your comprehension skills. Some sections of the book are challenging, but don’t worry, we’ll get through it together!</p><p>The first class of each week will be mainly devoted to film. You will be required to watch two Indonesian films, which will be discussed in class. We will explore the social, cultural and political issues that these films raise. Your comprehension of these films will be tested in the final exam.</p><p>Your research project will give you experience in using Indonesian newspapers, academic journals and other sources. Presentations and discussions of your research in class and on LMS (Blackboard) will give you an opportunity to lift your language beyond the level of everyday conversation and use them through different modes of communication. The project will involve an in-class presentation, essay, and discussions on Blackboard. </p><p>You will also receive a participation mark and be required to complete exercises at home (some of which will be marked). See below for details and check the unit site on LMS on a regular basis. </p><p><strong>Non-contact or home study consists of the following:</strong></p><p><i>1. Preparation for class </i></p><p>The homework section of your weekly study program lists what you have to do each week. You will also be assigned other exercises as we go. </p><p><i>2. Assignments</i></p><p>You will be required to submit a book review and a major research assignment, consisting of a 1300 words academic essay in Indonesian (details provided below). Please note that all written work submitted for assessment should be typed and double-spaced in hard copy. (However, handwritten work will be accepted as long as they are legible.)</p><p>All assignments are to be sent to your lecturer. Pay attention to the due date.</p><p><i>3. LMS participation</i></p><p>You will be required to participate in online exercises on Blackboard. See below for details.	</p><p><strong>Outcomes</strong><br></p><p>On successful completion of this unit students can expect to be able to:</p><p>1	perform very effectively in situations pertinent to social and community life and everyday commerce and recreation, and generally in almost all situations pertinent to their own vocational fields—students achieve a high level of 'vocational proficiency' (Level 4) as defined by the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings; reach a high level of spoken and written Indonesian;</p><p>2	understand complex texts of an intellectual nature and detailed texts in particular areas of interest and expertise; demonstrate a knowledge of contemporary literature and film;</p><p>3	write well enough to discuss abstract and complex issues and ideas; express opinions with a relatively high degree of nuance; read and write academic Indonesian;</p><p>4	convey their meaning in straightforward situations with virtually the same precision and complexity as do native speakers of the same socio-cultural variety; analyse a social, cultural or political issue using authentic Indonesian source materials; demonstrate an awareness of the social and political context of literary and cinematic production;&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

For each hour in class there is a focus on particular skills. This normally follows the following pattern:</p><p>Class 1: Discussing the target film  </p><p>Class 2: Discussing the novel </p><p>Additional Study and Practice</p><p>You should be spending at least 8 hours a week outside of class to study and practice for this unit. Take every opportunity to practice your Indonesian and to listen to it being spoken!  There are many effective learning techniques (see information on language learning strategies in Helpful Websites below).  First of all, listen to/watch as much of the material on LMS as you can. You can also listen to Indonesian radio via the internet (see Helpful Websites below) and Indonesian TV news is on SBS at 05.30 am on weekdays. Find a native speaker (there are plenty on campus!) and discuss the social, cultural and political issues with him/her. Read aloud to yourself. Varied learning methods are useful and they avoid monotony. If you are having trouble with some aspect of the language, let me know. You are welcome to come and see me during or outside consultation hours.</p><p>Non-contact or home study consists of the following:</p><p>1.

Failing to attend at other times will result in poor marks for class participation so it is recommended that students attend all classes.  Marks of 0-100% will be awarded for your general participation in all activities, not just for the specific assessment items. There are various activities, such as spontaneous conversations, speaking, reading comprehension, viewing, and listening. Effective participation in the unit requires that you devote a minimum of eight hours per week to learning activities.  These consist of two contact hours and at least eight hours of non-contact or home study.  Thus, for every class you should be doing a minimum additional four hours of study.</p><p>- In accordance with Faculty regulations, any student who does not make satisfactory progress in the course may be excluded from taking the final examination.</p><p>- A penalty of 5 per cent of the possible mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays), after which the assigned work is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due. For example, a student, who has submitted a piece of work for an assessment item late by three days and was scored a mark of 45 out of a possible mark of 50, receives after penalty a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day as a penalty for each student from the mark obtained). Where there are several tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied holistically to the assessment item after all tasks have been completed. If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course.</p><p>- Students may not submit a piece of work twice, either in the Unit or from other Units. Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
