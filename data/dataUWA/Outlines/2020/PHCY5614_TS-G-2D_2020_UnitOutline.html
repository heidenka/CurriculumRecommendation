                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>PHCY5614 Pharmacy Research Project offers you the opportunity to take responsibility for a research project under the guidance and advice of a supervisor in a research team. The primary purpose is to provide you with basic training in the research process. In this regard, the measurement of a satisfactory endpoint is the same, irrespective of whether the project involves bench work, clinical study, interviews, survey or literature review. There are two parts to the undertaking of the pharmacy research project. You would have been allocated a research project and completed the literature review in the previous trimester under the requirements of PHCY5609 Fundamentals of Research in Pharmacy (FRP). This guidebook explains the framework for the execution of the research project and its final assessment in PHCY5614. It will answer nearly all the questions that will arise in the course of the trimester and when you are preparing for your oral and written assessments at the end of the project.<br></p></p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Lecture Capture System</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>In accordance with UWA’s policy on lecture capture all lectures* in enabled venues will be recorded and made available to stream and download by enrolled students via the Lecture Capture System (LCS) for the duration of the unit (including Supplementary and Deferred Examinations period).

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>The pharmacy research project is hypothesis-driven. Working with research partners under the guidance of a supervisor within a research team, you will gather the relevant information from a literature evaluation, formulate a hypothesis, design the methodology, organise the resources, perform the study, organise and interpret the data, and communicate your findings in written and oral form for the allocated research project. You may have to conduct the study in a wet laboratory, or at pharmacy practice sites, such as hospitals, community pharmacies, nursing homes, etc. Where applicable, you may be required to assist in the application for approval of the research from the UWA human research ethics or animal research ethics committees. You are encouraged to show personal initiative and independence, and to discuss your input with your supervisor. Supervisors are generally receptive to new ideas and originality because it provides evidence that you have thought more deeply about the project. At the completion of data collection and analysis, you will defend your research to your peers, academic staff and other interested parties. In the assessment of this unit, we will be looking for evidence that you have gained insight into the process of solving a research problem from beginning to end.</p></p></pre></p>

You will have the equivalent of 4.5 days per week for 10 weeks to complete your research report. How, when and where you spend the time to complete the research will depend on the requirements of the research and the directions of your supervisors. This unit requires you to work closely with your supervisors and research team members. The project framework will be established in consultation with your supervisors, but it will be up to you and your team members to develop and execute the research study on a day-to-day basis.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

During this period, full time students are expected to commit 4.5 days per week to the research. Part time students will have to discuss your circumstances with your group members and supervisors and specify the days on which you will attend to the research in person with the group. </p><p>You are required to attend to all the activities required for the successful execution of the research project. This includes formal and informal meetings with the research group and supervisors, execution of the study, and data analyses. If you are unable to attend due to an exceptional circumstance, you must discuss the circumstance with the supervisor and obtain an approved leave of absence. </p><p>For you are a full time student, it is not acceptable to schedule paid/volunteer work or extracurricular activities during the PHCY5614 sessions in your timetable. </p><p>You should also note that, whether you are a full time or part time student, if you persistently fail to contribute to the activities required for the successful execution of the research project, you can expect to be allocated a separate project and asked to submit a separate written research report. We have taken this action in the past when the students had so severely impacted on the group dynamics that they had to be separated from the group in order not to adversely impact on the academic outcomes of the other team members. </p><p>Attendance at the workshop on writing your research report, the two coordinator’s meetings and the final research seminar is compulsory. Failure to meet the requirement of at least 80% attendance in these classes may result in a report of Professional Misconduct being made.</p></p></pre></p>

It is reflected both in individual and group approaches to study and assessment tasks, and is part of a broader institutional commitment to maintain and extend robust, defensible and transparent educational standards and practices.</p><p>Academic Literacy may be defined as the capacity to undertake study and research, and to communicate findings and knowledge, in a manner appropriate to the particular disciplinary conventions and scholarly standards expected at university level.</p><p>Academic Integrity or Academic Conduct means acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research.</p><p>Breach of Academic Conduct is any activity or practice engaged in by a student that violates explicit guidelines relating to the production of work for assessment, in a manner that compromises or defeats the purpose of that assessment. Any such activity undermines an ethos of ethical scholarship.</p><p>Levels of breaches of Academic Conduct relates to the severity of the breach and are defined as Minor Breach of Academic Conduct (Level 1); Moderate Breach of Academic Conduct (Level 2); and Major Breach of Academic Conduct (Level 3).</p><p>1.	Level 1: Minor Breach of Academic Conduct</p><p>Examples of minor breaches may include but are not limited to:</p><p>•	Minor plagiarism </p><p>•	Minor copying of material </p><p>•	Copying of answers to questions at the end of laboratory practicals.</p><p>2.	Level 2: Moderate Breach of Academic Conduct</p><p>Examples of moderate breaches may include but are not limited to:</p><p>•	Moderate plagiarism</p><p>•	Recycling an item of assessment</p><p>•	Fabricating or falsifying data</p><p>•	Colluding with another student about assessable work and representing that as individual work</p><p>3.	Level 3: Major Breach of Academic Conduct</p><p>Breaches are deemed MAJOR where the activity may be reasonably judged to be a serious and substantial breach of ethical scholarship and includes (but is not limited to):</p><p>•	Cheating in examinations</p><p>•	Major plagiarism</p><p>•	Fabricating or falsifying data</p><p>•	Submitting the work of another person as your own or undertaking work for assessment for another person (ghost writing)</p><p>Plagiarism </p><p>Detection software is utilised at UWA to indicate potential breaches related to plagiarism. The following scale has been adopted for the purposes of preliminary classification of plagiarism:</p><p>•	Level 1 – less than 10% (minor)</p><p>•	Level 2 – 10 – 25% (moderate)</p><p>•	Level 3 – more than 25% (major)</p></p></pre></p>

In the process, you will become proficient in searching, selecting, reviewing and applying the published literature to design your research methodology, trouble shoot research problems, and analyse and interpret your research data. </p><p>It is normal to be anxious initially, as you struggle to determine the scope of information that is necessary to complete the research. During this period, you must not be reluctant to consult your supervisor, the senior members of the research team and the librarians. Seek help to know where or how to start, what to read, or if you are unable to obtain a specific published literature for your research. As you apply yourself to this task, you will gradually gain confidence.</p><p>The reading materials will consist of textbooks, pharmacopoeia standards, official reports (e.g. WA Department of Health reports), published journal articles and others, including previous MPharm research reports. These reference materials are available from the library, your supervisors or the site where you conduct the research study. The online modules that you have read in PHCY5609 FRP are also very helpful resources for conducting your research study.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

This includes the laboratories located at the Curnow Building. </p><p>You will need a calculator for your research project. </p><p>Equipment in the Laboratories</p><p>If you are conducting research that involves wet lab experiments and equipment, you would receive the relevant technical training. If you do not feel competent to perform an experiment or use an equipment, you must let the technician know, and additional training sessions would be provided if necessary. It is very important that you do not use any equipment without approval from the technician. You must also not move any equipment from their location without consulting the technician. All safety requirements must be observed when working with equipment in the laboratories.</p><p>To help us track the usage of all equipment, you must sign the log sheets every time you use an equipment. Equipment instruction protocols must be followed through as the improper use of an equipment will result in damage that will delay not only your research but potentially also the research of other groups.   </p><p>Software requirements</p><p>Documents posted on LMS will mostly be PDF documents. You will also need to access and use MS Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Endnote, and statistical packages as recommended by your supervisor. </p><p>Microsoft Office 365 for Students</p><p>A new agreement between UWA and Microsoft enables all current UWA students to download and install the full Office 365 suite for free on their personal devices, and also access 1TB of cloud storage in OneDrive. While enrolled at UWA, the full Microsoft Office 365 suite (including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Outlook) can be installed not only onto your PC, Mac, Android or IOS device, but you will also have access to online versions of the same Microsoft Office 365 products via your browser, giving you the flexibility and freedom to access your files and use the Microsoft Office 365 Suite wherever you are. </p><p>More detail about Microsoft Office 365 for Students at UWA, including important support and training information can be found here: <a href='http://www.bits.uwa.edu.au/servicecatalogue/software/office' target='_blank' >http://www.bits.uwa.edu.au/servicecatalogue/software/office</a>‐365</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
