The unit examines identity and worldview and the wider society's attitudes towards Aboriginal people and what people mean when they speak of 'Aboriginal education'. Students are asked to critically reflect on how they locate themselves, their world views and perceptions within Aboriginal Education. The unit will examine historical relationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia and the impact of colonisation, governmental policies and practices on all aspects of life and, in particular, education. 'Aboriginal education' is considered in the context of social justice and Indigenous and human rights issues which continue to affect Aboriginal people and their relationships with the wider Australian community. The focus of this unit is to help develop cultural understandings that will enable teachers to embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives and draw on strategies that are culturally responsive within an educational context.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit will provide an introduction to a range of perspectives and understandings that will help students work effectively with Indigenous students, youth and families within the Australian/Western Australian education system. The unit examines identity and worldview and the wider society's attitudes towards Aboriginal people and what people mean when they speak of 'Aboriginal education'. Students are asked to critically reflect on how they locate themselves, their world views and perceptions within Aboriginal Education. The unit will examine historical relationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia and the impact of colonisation, governmental policies and practices on all aspects of life and in particular, education. 'Aboriginal education' is considered in the context of social justice and Indigenous and human rights issues which continue to affect Aboriginal people and their relationships with the wider Australian community. The focus of this unit is to help develop cultural understandings that will enable teachers to embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives and draw on strategies that are culturally responsive within an educational context.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>The Teaching and Learning Strategy of this unit based on a variety of current teaching and learning strategies which will assist in preparing pre-service teachers to teach in diverse and technological educational spaces. The unit design follows principles of the ‘flipped classroom”. You can access this link for more information on ‘Flipped Classrooms” <a href='https://www.adelaide.edu.au/flipped-classroom/about/' target='_blank' >https://www.adelaide.edu.au/flipped-classroom/about/</a>.</p><p>Online preparation tasks, seminars, workshops and learning on Country are the learning designs in EDUC5429. It is expected that you will develop and enhance your knowledge by engaging in the learning opportunities throughout the unit. The engagements will reflect the values as expressed in cross-cultural learning environments in which a key component is critical reflection based on preparation and willingness to share what is known at that moment. Attention is focused on acquiring knowledge through engagement in online and face to face activities, discussion and sharing. </p><p>These learning strategies are an opportunity for you to develop your professionalism, especially in the context of working in schools. It is important for you to practice maintaining high standards of professional conduct and commitment throughout the unit, this will be reflected in your attitudes to learning and behaviors as you engage in the learning offered.</p><p><strong><i>ISE – Indigenous Studies Essentials:</i></strong> Week ‘O’ Entry Task for Aboriginal Perspectives in Education</p><p>Complete the ISE module before week 1 workshop as an introduction or a refresher (ISE link is on LMS) (approx. 1-2hours to complete). The ISE module is an introduction or reflection of some essential Indigenous understandings which will assist in familiarising you with the context of this unit. </p><p><strong><i>Online Preparation Tasks&nbsp;</i></strong>- See Modules on LMS</p><p>Weekly online pre-workshop preparation tasks which include: a review of previous week’s seminar content in the form of a self assessed quiz; guided reading components (article extracts or a full article); guided viewing components (each video ranging from 10mins to 45mins duration); diagram or notes pertaining to reading/viewing to bring to the workshop for the workshop activity; discussion board post based on a set question connecting with the guided reading/viewing (approximately 100 words).</p><p><strong><i>Seminars</i></strong></p><p>Weekly seminars will be presented by professionals/educators from Aboriginal Education sectors in education who are knowledgeable in the specific topic. The aim of using seminars is to move beyond a lecture of content and to stimulate critical thinking and raise questions in order to increase learning about concepts offered in each seminar. In preparation for each seminar please analyse weekly course materials and note any queries to bring to the presentation. Opportunities to ask questions will be offered and a dialogue will support the directions the seminar will cover. Completing the Essential Readings/Viewings will enable you to gain deeper understandings of seminar concepts. </p><p><strong><i>Workshops</i></strong></p><p>A dialogic and transformative learning approach is fundamental to the workshop design of this unit (for you own information <a href='http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1002.9078&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf' target='_blank' >http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1002.9078&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a>). Workshops will be interactive using both activity based and dialogic approaches. To be able to engage in the classroom dialogue and activities students will need to reflect on and analyse their understandings the content/points in unit materials provided in online preparation tasks on LMS and in seminars. A dialogic and transformative learning approach requires students to reflect on and share understandings and perspectives about the unit content/points being raised.&nbsp;Critical reflective components of the activities and the dialogic approaches are designed stimulate students’ transformative learning and facilitate deeper understandings.</p><p>To be able to engage fully in your learning ensure you prepare for your workshops by accessing the weekly workshop guide and by completing the Online Preparation Tasks on LMS.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong><i>Workshop Guides</i></strong></p><p>Workshop guides have been designed to provide some background information on the week’s content. It would be beneficial to consult the workshop guide as it also sets out all your tasks or information for Online, Seminar and Workshop components for each week.</p><p><strong><i>Learning on Country - Field Trip</i></strong></p><p>Learning on Country is a significant component of learning for Indigenous students/peoples and also for non-Indigenous students/peoples’ learning. Country encompasses more than just the physical environment, it is knowledge, the ancestors, kin/people and spiritual. Learning on Country is a way of learning through connecting with Country and the knowledge within Country.</p><p>Please note: students will need to attend and participate in all Online Preparation Tasks, Seminars (or view), Workshops and Excursions. Clashes with timetabling and or other unit requirements will need to be solved prior to this core unit’s commencement.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
