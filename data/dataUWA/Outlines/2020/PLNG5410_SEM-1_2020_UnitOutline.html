                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Welcome to Geography and Planning Practicum (PLNG5410).</p><p>This course introduces students to the ‘real’ world of professional planning practice by offering you the chance to undertake a work-based practicum with a planning agency in Perth/WA.</p><p>For some/many of you, this will be your first experience of working in a planning office/department whether it be in a local government, the Department of Planning Lands and Heritage, a planning consultancy or even within the property development sector. Since the inception of the course, the range of practicum host organisations has expanded to cover local government, the private sector, the Department of Planning Lands and Heritage and the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority as the urban/regional planning programme at UWA continues to develop.</p><p>It is essential, therefore, that all practicum students are familiar with the expectations associated with this unit and, in particular, with your responsibilities as a student representing the University of Western Australia and the Urban and Regional Planning programme when on practicum.</p><p><strong>Goal</strong></p><p>The overall aims of this course are to apply and enhance your overall intellectual understanding of planning as developed in units PLNG4401, PLNG4402, PLNG4403, and PLNG4404 and provide you with an opportunity to translate this knowledge into practical planning skills by working within the planning system. Depending on the type of planning organisation where you do your practicum you may find yourself working in areas such as development assessment, local planning strategies, strategic policy development and/or subdivision assessment. You may end up “specialising” in a particular area of planning or your practicum employer may expose you to a variety of aspects of planning practice. Ideally, I will be liaising with prospective practicum employers in an effort to ensure that your practicum involves task-specific activities that relate directly to planning practice.</p></p></pre></p>

There will be individual debrief sessions with all practicum students prior to their commencement of employment to outline and reiterate responsibilities whilst on practicum. The date for this will be determined in due course. In addition, the course co-ordinators will make at least one visit during the practicum period to see how you are progressing and to get an update report from your line manager/mentor.</p><p><strong>Unit schedule</strong></p><p>Students are expected to work between 21-28 days over the course of the practicum period. Ideally, you should work no more than 2-3 days per week (if also studying full-time) however you should discuss and negotiate your own working schedule with your practicum employer to fit in with any other academic commitments (e.g. research project) that you may have over the semester.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
