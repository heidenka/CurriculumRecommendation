As scholars of Indigenous knowledge, you will need to be strong team players and subsequently know how to achieve creative and efficient teamwork together with exemplary outcomes. Following the prescribed schedule, Student Groups will provide an analytical presentation on a given topic as well as facilitate a subsequent wider class discussion on that topic. You will need to answer the question critically with all source materials referenced – including visual imagery - rather than simply reproduce, or list, materials from the sources provided. Your job is to research beyond the materials provided, beyond the internet and into the libraries wherever possible.</p><p>Specifications and deadlines:</p><p>As a team, provide a 20 minute electronic presentation (e.g. PowerPoint) of your scheduled topic. Aim to answer the questions, summarise and critique the salient points of the selected works and explain how we can best learn from these topics as scholars and practitioners devoted to working with Indigenous peoples. Conclude your presentation with further questions to facilitate a wider class discussion on the topic. Your electronic presentations should be beautifully crafted and communicated to the class. Allocate tasks equitably and not all team members need to present to the class, as such.</p><p>Students are to submit their group power point via LMS by 5pm on the day of your presentation. Refer instructions on the unit’s LMS site.</p><p>Deadline – At the end of your tutorial presentation as per weekly schedule.</p><p>Assignment 3 – Major Essay – 50%</p><p>Aims:  </p><p>This exercise aims to enhance your critical and creative research and documentation skills pertaining to the unit’s key lecture topics. This essay is designed to develop your skills in critically analysing a particular topic by dissecting its meaning and interrogating its relevance to your scholarship in a clear and concise manner. Your discussion and conclusions should be kept to the specific topic and to the specific question and follow exact referencing guidelines. You will need to answer the question critically with all source materials referenced – including visual imagery - rather than simply reproduce, or list, materials from the sources provided. Once again, your job is to research beyond the materials provided, beyond the internet and into the libraries wherever possible.</p><p>Specifications and Deadlines:</p><p>Select a tutorial question different to the one you presented in the tutorial and write a 1,500 word essay on that new topic Assignment 3 – Final Essay – due by Tuesday 2 June 2020.

Further criteria are provided for non-written assignment work if this is combined with the Unit’s Assessment Mechanism.  </p><p>Additional essay writing advice can be found at:</p><p><a href='http://www.sis.uwa.edu.au' target='_blank' >http://www.sis.uwa.edu.au</a>/students/essay-writing-advice</p><p>Plagiarism and Academic Conduct </p><p>Academic misconduct includes plagiarism, collusion and other forms of cheating. The University of Western Australia defines Academic Misconduct as "any activity or practice engaged in by a student that breaches explicit guidelines relating to the production of work for assessment, in a manner that compromises or defeats the purpose of that assessment".</p><p>Plagiarism occurs when someone disguises or misrepresents the authorship of work and claims it as his or her own. It can occur in various forms:</p><p>(i)	presenting, part or whole of another student's essay, design project or artwork as one's own;</p><p>(ii)	copying phrases, sentences or passages from a published source (usually an article or a book) without acknowledging this by quotation marks and a reference;</p><p>(iii)	substantially copying design elements or images from other design projects or artworks, such as to misrepresent the substance, strategy or personal expression of the original design project or artwork;</p><p>(iii)	presenting in your own words an idea, argument or interruption from another source, without indicating the reference</p><p>Remember always to insert references when using other people's ideas.</p><p>What are the penalties?</p><p>Plagiarism strikes at the heart of ethical scholarship, and the School has grown increasingly concerned about plagiarism in student essays. In addition to being a form of fraud, plagiarism negates the value of essays, designs or artworks as a means of developing independent thought, analysis, design strategy or creative expression. </p><p>Unintentional plagiarism will also be penalised. The University views plagiarism very seriously and substantial or repeated plagiarism may result in a student's failing the course or, in extreme cases, being expelled from the University. The defense "but I have done this for other departments or teachers" is unacceptable - it is rather like the driver who, when caught speeding, complains that (s)he hasn't been caught before.</p><p>How to Avoid Plagiarism</p><p>The best way to avoid plagiarism in essay writing is to get into the habit of distinguishing your own work from that by other people. We assume that unreferenced work is your own, so make sure that phrases and sentences that are not your own are in quotation marks and given precise references, and that ideas and arguments that are not your own are properly referenced. In cases of concepts or facts that are widely used or known this may not be necessary - for example "liberals believe in the importance of individual freedom" or "Australia has six states". To avoid accidental plagiarism, ensure that the notes you use to prepare your essay clearly identify quotations and have full references.</p><p>Referencing </p><p>For this Unit the only acceptable format for referencing and notation will be Chicago footnoted based system as summarised here: <a href='https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/Chicago_citation' target='_blank' >https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/Chicago_citation</a></p><p> </p><p>You are required to include footnoted citations and include a reference list. Supportive figures, illustrations used in the essay should be referenced in their titles using footnoted citations. Essays and assignments will be assessed according to the adherence of these referencing standards.</p><p>Presentation Formats</p><p>It is recommended that essays be typed. Essay text should be 12 point, in a clear font, e.g. Arial, Helvetica, Times, New York, Palatino or similar, with lines one and one-half spaced.  </p><p>Paragraphs should be denoted by a single extra return (you may indent paragraphs if you wish). Please do not use extraneous formatting, such as headers, footers or tabs if they are not necessary.  Please include page numbers.  The required length of the essay does not include footnotes.</p><p>A Guide To Appropriate Language And Terminology</p><p>It is important to be sensitive to the use of appropriate language and terminology when referring to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This guide is to inform you on preferred terminology for the School of Indigenous Studies, so you can become more confident in your choices about what terms to use. However, it is not definitive and cannot cover all contexts, so as a general rule, if in doubt, ASK first!</p><p>Collective and Inclusive Terms</p><p>‘Indigenous people(s)’ and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people(s)’ are terms commonly used to collectively refer to Australia’s first peoples.</p><p>‘Indigenous peoples’ is a term most frequently used in an international context, particularly in relation to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) and The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples <a href='http://social.un.org/index/IndigenousPeoples.aspx' target='_blank' >http://social.un.org/index/IndigenousPeoples.aspx</a></p><p>For more information see:  Indigenous Peoples Indigenous Voices Fact Sheet: Who Are Indigenous Peoples? <a href='http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf' target='_blank' >http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf</a></p><p>Some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people object to using the term ‘Indigenous’ because it fails to respect their own identity and preferences and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ is the preferred term. </p><p>However, both terms ‘Indigenous people(s)’ and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people(s)’ are acceptable to use in the course. Use capital letters for ‘Indigenous’ and ‘Aboriginal’ when you are referring specifically to Aboriginal peoples in Australia.</p><p>In many areas, the term ‘Aboriginal people’ is increasingly used in preference to ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’.  In Western Australia there has been a clear and stated community preference for use of the term ‘Aboriginal people’ as the inclusive term rather than ‘Indigenous’ or ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’. This is demonstrated by the following examples from two key government agencies:</p><p>  </p><p>•	In 2013, Western Australia’s Department of Indigenous Affairs replaced the term ‘Indigenous’ in its title with ‘Aboriginal’, its stated reason being that: "The Department of Aboriginal Affairs (formerly Indigenous Affairs) has been renamed to more accurately reflect the identity of Aboriginal people in Western Australia. This change is in line with requests from the State's Aboriginal community." <a href='http://www.daa.wa.gov.au' target='_blank' >http://www.daa.wa.gov.au</a>/</p><p>•	The Department of Health (WA) stated rationale on using the term ‘Aboriginal’ is that: "Within Western Australia, the term Aboriginal is used in preference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, in recognition that Aboriginal people are the original inhabitants of Western Australia. No disrespect is intended to our Torres Strait Islander colleagues and community”. <a href='http://www.aboriginal.health.wa.gov.au/home/' target='_blank' >http://www.aboriginal.health.wa.gov.au/home/</a></p><p>Diverse Communities</p><p>‘Aboriginal’ and ‘Indigenous’ are both terms imposed after colonisation, which don’t reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of the many Aboriginal language groups across Australia as well as the diversity within each of these groups.</p><p>Aboriginal people prefer to identify themselves in their own language terms e.g. Noongar, Koori, Palyku, Murri, Yamatji or Wongi.  Students should be sensitive to this use, but care should be taken to have an appropriate Aboriginal reference point when using these terms. It can be confusing as spellings may have changed over time or may merely reflect regional or individual preferences. For example, UWA uses ‘Noongar’ as per the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council <a href='http://www.noongar.org.au' target='_blank' >http://www.noongar.org.au</a></p><p> </p><p>POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</p><p>COMMUNICATION</p><p>When you enrol at UWA you are automatically assigned a student email address. This address is then used for official electronic correspondence unless you advise in writing that this is not acceptable. For more information about your UWA Student Email account and services available you should visit www.ucs.uwa.edu.au/web/students/email</p><p>Staff may communicate with students by email, either directly or through the unit’s LMS portal, so all students should ensure that they:</p><p>•	check their account and the unit LMS site regularly (at least twice per week); and</p><p>•	communicate with University staff ONLY through their student email account. </p><p>(Staff are not required to respond by email to any other addresses.)</p><p>UNIVERSITY POLICY ON ASSESSMENT</p><p>Students are encouraged to read and familiarise themselves with the University Policy on Assessment. </p><p>UNIT ATTENDANCE, ENGAGEMENT AND PARTICIPATION </p><p>The School of Indigenous Studies requires students to attend all classes in accordance with the University's Policy on Academic Progress 3.1(a). Complying to this Student Rule is particularly relevant where a unit may have an attendance, engagement and participation assessment component to its overall unit grade and or rely on a shared learning experience in or out of the class room as detailed in the unit's outline.</p><p>If there is an assessment component for a unit based on tutorial attendance, engagement and participation this will call for an active engagement with all the materials presented in the class whether delivered by staff or by fellow students. Active engagements calls for prior reading and preparation for all classes with questions prepared ahead of time to assist with class discussions and seminar debates. Staff will monitor and document this engagement, as well as ask for seminar feedback during every class to assist with the unit participation assessment. If any student cannot make class then they are advised to email the Unit Coordinator as soon as possible.</p><p>SUBMISSION OF ASSESSMENT ITEMS</p><p>This procedure provides guidance for students on the timely and suitable completion of assignment work and the penalties that apply to the submission of late work.</p><p>•	All assessment tasks are due no later than the deadlines and procedures for submission clearly indicated in the Unit's Assessment Mechanism Statement, with the exception of in-class assessment items such as tutorial presentations.  </p><p>•	All assessment items submitted later than 7 days after the deadline receive a mark of zero, unless an application is approved in accordance with the University Policy on Special Consideration (see below for information about Special Consideration).</p><p>•	A penalty of 5 per cent of the possible mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays), after which the assigned work is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p><p>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION</p><p>If your study or ability to meet assessment deadlines has been severely affected by illness or other factors outside your control, you can apply for special consideration at your Allocated Course Advice Office. Special consideration can take into account significant and unforeseen factors that may have affected your academic preparation or performance, such as:</p><p>•	significant personal illness</p><p>•	death or serious illness of someone close to you</p><p>•	other significant circumstances.</p><p>Your Allocated Course Advice Office can consider:</p><p>•	extensions for assignments</p><p>•	withdrawal or changes to courses</p><p>•	changes to your final grade in a unit of study</p><p>•	deferred examinations. </p><p>To apply for special consideration, complete the Special Consideration Form (www.student.uwa.edu.au/course/exams/consideration) and submit it to your Allocated Course Advice Office. The coordinator/s of this unit will be notified of the outcome of your application. Please note that in all cases, requests for assignment extensions must be submitted before the due date. </p><p>To view the University Policy on Special Consideration go to: </p><p>www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP11%2F23.</p><p>WORD LIMITS</p><p>Written assessment items (eg. essays) will have a target word count included in the Unit's Assessment Mechanism statement. Students are permitted to be over or under the target word count without penalty. </p><p>If a student exceeds the target word count by more than 10%, a penalty of 1% of the total mark allocated for the assessment item will be applied for each 1% in excess of the word limit. </p><p>For example, if the target word count is 2000 students can write between 1800-2200 words without penalty. However for every 1% over 2200 a penalty of 1% will apply.</p><p>The word count includes in-text referencing but does not include the bibliography. Students must provide a word count at the top of their assessment item at the time of submission.</p><p>ASSESSMENT FEEDBACK </p><p>In accordance with the University Policy on Assessment, feedback on summative assessments items will be provided to students within 15 University working days from the submission deadline and at least one week before the next assessment item is due. </p><p>UNIVERSITY POLICY ON REVIEW AND APPEAL OF ACADEMIC DECISIONS </p><p>In accordance with the University Policy on Review and Appeal of Academic Decisions Relating to Students, a student may request a review of an academic decision relating to them, and to appeal if they are dissatisfied with the outcome of that review. An academic decision may include, but is not limited to:</p><p>•	assessment outcomes</p><p>•	final grade or final mark for a unit</p><p>•	progress status</p><p>•	advanced standing</p><p>•	changes to enrolment</p><p>•	requests for approved leave</p><p>•	special consideration (including deferred examinations)</p><p>The University manages review and appeals of academic decisions relating to students as follows:</p><p>Review</p><p>Stage 1: Where academic decisions relating to students are reviewed by the original decision-maker or decision-making body.</p><p>Stage 2: Where academic decisions relating to students are reviewed by a higher authority appointed by the Registrar. It is anticipated that the bulk of matters will be resolved satisfactorily at either Stage 1 or Stage 2.</p><p>Appeal</p><p>A review at Stage 1 or Stage 2 must have occurred before a student can appeal against an academic decision. </p><p>Students can access the Review and Appeal forms at this link:</p><p>www.governance.uwa.edu.au/committees/appeals-committee/review-and-appeal-of-academic-decisions-relating-to-students</p><p>It is recommended that students informally discuss their concerns with the relevant unit co-ordinator or academic staff member PRIOR to lodging a formal request for review, but should note that formal requests for review must be lodged within 5 working days of receipt of the academic decision. </p><p>ETHICAL SCHOLARSHIP, ACADEMIC LITERACY AND ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT</p><p>Ethical scholarship is the pursuit of scholarly enquiry marked by honesty and integrity.</p><p> </p><p>Academic Literacy is the capacity to undertake study and research, and to communicate findings and knowledge, in a manner appropriate to the particular disciplinary conventions and scholarly standards expected at university level.  </p><p>Academic misconduct includes plagiarism, collusion and other forms of cheating. The University of Western Australia defines Academic Misconduct as "any activity or practice engaged in by a student that breaches explicit guidelines relating to the production of work for assessment, in a manner that compromises or defeats the purpose of that assessment".  Guidelines for avoiding plagiarism are also provided below in the Essay Writing Guidelines Section. The full University misconduct policy is available at: www.uwastudentguild.com/assist/academic/academic-misconduct/</p><p>USE OF STUDENT FEEDBACK</p><p>Students are invited and encouraged to complete a SURF questionnaire at the end of the course. Further, students are welcome throughout the semester to discuss any issues raised in class that require further clarification. Don’t hesitate to ask during or after class!</p><p>INCIDENTAL FEES AND CHARGES</p><p>This unit has an extra incidental fee of $60 for the field trip in week 11.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
