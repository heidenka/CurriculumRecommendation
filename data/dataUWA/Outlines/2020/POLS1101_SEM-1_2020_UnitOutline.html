                                    <td>Liberal democracy is now the preferred political system and professed destination of most of the world's states. But this is a very recent development. Until a couple of decades ago, communism was a major alternative on the world stage; earlier in the century fascism was also a serious rival, and before the twentieth century very few people had anything favourable to say about democracy in modern states. This unit examines this potent political force from two main perspectives. It traces the foundational ideas of liberal democracy, such as limited government, personal liberty, individual rights, political equality, majority rule and political participation, together with the development of these ideas by major thinkers. It looks also at the some criticisms of these liberal-democratic ideals. The unit then goes on to compare the different ways in which these principles are incorporated in actual political systems—those that emphasise liberty (e.g. the United States), those that emphasise majority rule (e.g. Britain), and the Australian case that is often seen as a blend of the American and British systems. We then move on to democracy in Asia by examining the political systems of Japan and Indonesia before concluding with China's alternative to liberal democracy. The key question here is whether Asian forms of politics and democracy offer an alternative to traditional Western types of liberal-democracy.

In general, the unit equips students with an understanding of the ideas and institutions that comprise liberal democracy today, it encourages them to reflect on which institutions best realise its key principles, and it requires the student to think of possible alternatives to the liberal-democratic model.</td>

                    <p>POLS1101 - The Liberal Democratic State - SEM-1-2020 - 2020 - Face to face / Blended learning</p>
                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Liberal-democracy is now the preferred system of government for virtually all of the world’s developed states, and many developing states too. By the late 20th and early 21st centuries, it seemed that liberal-democracy had effectively ‘seen off’ a series of alternative models of political-economy (monarchy/aristocracy, fascism and communism in particular).</p><p> </p><p>In 2020 this triumphalist tone is difficult to sustain. Within the traditional  ‘western’ liberal democracies we can see signs of anti or ‘illiberal’ democracies. In the developing world authoritarian capitalism (of the sort practiced in China) offers a challenge to the suggestion that capitalist growth is intertwined with liberal institutions and democratic government.</p><p> </p><p>As the liberal democratic state is being questioned it is important to revisit some of the foundational questions related to the development and functioning of liberal democracy.</p><p> </p><p>Part 1 starts by considering the wider historical context that liberal democratic states emerged within. In Part 2 we move to consider the features and development of the modern state, and what it means to be a ‘democratic’ and ‘liberal’ state. Part 3 takes these broader themes and explores how they are expressed in three key English speaking liberal-democratic systems: the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia. Part 4 focuses on understanding the features of societies that liberal democracies are meant to foster and be sustained by. Finally, Part 5 examines some of the contemporary challenges to the liberal democratic state.</p><p> </p><p>By the end of this course you will be well-prepared to take further study of politics - and other social science topics  (including sociology, anthropology, public policy, philosophy,  history, and international relations) - should you choose to major in these fields. What you will learn will also equip you  to pursue excellence in a range of other academic fields at UWA. But perhaps most importantly, you will better understand the key values and institutions – and the challenges to such – which shape public life in liberal-democratic societies. Understanding these matters will equip you to be a better, more-self-aware and hopefully more-active citizen.</p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Teaching in the unit is conducted through lectures and tutorials.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Lectures</strong></p><p>You have  two lectures per week - on Mondays  at 5pm and on Wednesdays 12pm (midday). Lecture timetabling is worked out centrally by the university's admin teams. Lecturers are not able to change the time or length of lectures. </p><p>Where will they take place?  All lectures will take place in the Social Science Lecture Theatre (G130)</p><p> </p><p>All lectures will be recorded and made available through the LMS.  Attendance at lectures is not compulsory, but we strongly urge you to attend all lectures because the learning experience is significantly enhanced when students are 'in person'.</p><p> </p><p>Lectures are not the same as school classes. A lecture is an overview of a topic which  (a) introduces students to key concepts and issues and  (b) provides guidance for the individual exploration of these topics through the readings and tutorial discussions.</p><p> </p><p>The majority of lectures will be given by Dr Jordan Tchilingirian (who is also the Unit Coordinator). Guest lectures will be given by Professors Benjamin Reilly (Democratisation) and David Denemark (America and Australia).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Tutors and Tutor groups</strong></p><p>You will also be taught in weekly tutorial groups. These groups discuss the topics covered in the lectures and reading. Tutorials provide a forum in which students can develop and test ideas, based on prior reading and reflection, in cooperation with their peers and under the supervision of a member of staff.</p><p>This year your tutors are:  Mr Seth Appiah-Mensah, Ms Sarah Meyers, Dr. Kane Matthews, and Dr Jordan Tchilingirian. Through your participation in tutorials, you should enhance your abilities:</p><p>to respect and comprehend the point of view of others;</p><p>to offer constructive reflection on the contributions of other students;</p><p>to make well organised, well informed, clearly articulated and concise oral arguments; and,</p><p>to work in a group context on identifying issues, exploring alternative approaches to their resolution, and drawing conclusions.</p><p> </p><p>Persistent absence without explanation from tutorials will negatively affect your tutorial participation mark.  Tutorials can be both a valuable learning experience and enjoyable, but you need to prepare  to obtain the maximum benefit from them by doing the allocated readings and preparing to answer the 3 discussion questions posed each week. Note that out of 12 teaching weeks there will be 10 tutorials; tutorials begin in week 3 and end in week 12 (the final teaching week).</p><p>Tutors should be your primary contact-point for enquiries about the course - especially when you need advice about the written assignments</p><p>Extensions: neither the tutors nor the Unit Coordinator (Dr Tchilingirian) can grant extensions. Instead, these are granted by the Student Office    </p><p>LMS: the UWA Learning Management System uses Blackboard software. You will need to become very familiar with the POLS 1101 site because it is used for a number of purposes, including:</p><p> - accessing key docs: the course outline, weekly readings, lecture slides, etc.</p><p> - accessing lecture-recordings (if you were sick and missed a lecture)</p><p> - submitting assignments (via the anti-plagiarism software Turn It In)</p><p>Note: Dr Tchilingirian and the tutors will likely send you regular ‘announcements’ to keep you updated about changes to the course; typically these messages will also appear in your UWA email accounts.</p></p></pre></p>

Students who prioritise their reading are more likely to pass - and pass with good marks. The reading for each lecture follows a similar 2 stage pattern: Key Reading and Further materials Key Reading consists of 2 - 3 materials, usually a book chapter from an edited volume, a chapter from a book, essay, research paper, or a short monograph . You will need to engage with these materials to understand the topic and to successfully engage in your tutorials. YOU WILL NOT BE SET 2 - 4 BOOKS FOR EVERY LECTURE Further materials are secondary texts written about the topic. These texts might give more details about a specific position or detail of the content covered in the Key Readings. You will notice some lists are longer than others. Don’t worry! You are not expected to read every text. All supplementary texts are guides to help you navigate the topic.&nbsp;</p><p>Textbooks</p><p>There are many textbooks devoted to issues relating to this unit. Unfortunately, due to the diverse range of topics we cover, you will not be able to use one textbook. However there are a few general texts that you may find useful&nbsp;</p><p>Crick, B. (2002). Democracy: A Very Short Introduction. Oup Oxford UK</p><p>Dahl, R. A. (2015). On Democracy. (2nd ed.). Yale University Press.&nbsp;</p><p>Both texts are available as e books through the university's library - you can find them by searching here <a href='https://onesearch.library.uwa.edu.au/discovery/search?vid=61UWA_INST:UWA&nbsp;' target='_blank' >https://onesearch.library.uwa.edu.au/discovery/search?vid=61UWA_INST:UWA&nbsp;</a></p><p>Please note that textbooks are for guidance only – they are no substitute for consistent study. You are expected to explore the readings listed here for every lecture/tutorial and in addition to look for sources in the library collection. Don’t feel constrained by the reading list – if you find something related to the topic in question read it and prepare to tell us about it….we want to know! The importance of ‘close’ reading Remember - the students who do best at this unit are the ones who undertake a close reading of the original texts written by each author. I strongly suggest you follow this practice NOTE: Some of the authors and debates in this course can be quite demanding. This is sometimes due to the complexity or abstractness of the issues. At other times this may be due to the writing style of the author. If you do not understand a term or concept it is best to begin by looking it up in a Dictionary of Political Science, Philosophy, or Sociology or similar reference text (sometimes Wikipedia is just too shallow). It can also be extremely helpful to discuss texts with other members of the course or other lecturers in the department. You should, of course, ask Jordan questions during (or just after) lectures, or office hours. Reading at your own paceIt is important that you find the right reading time/pattern that works for you. This is subjective and might take you a few weeks to develop and get used to. You will be given tips and hints about how to do this in your first lecture Changes to the reading list</p><p>Additional readings may be provided in the lectures - if there are any changes to reading lists you will be informed and the changes will be made on the LMS. How to find copies of your unit readingsThe majority of texts are available online through the university’s library. To access them you will need to use the ‘One Search’ tool (see link below). <a href='https://onesearch.library.uwa.edu.au/discovery/search?vid=61UWA_INST:UWA&nbsp;' target='_blank' >https://onesearch.library.uwa.edu.au/discovery/search?vid=61UWA_INST:UWA&nbsp;</a></p><p>Other texts will be in hard copies in the library. Again you will need to use the One Search tool to locate these materials</p><p>If a text is not available online or in hard copy there will be a PDF copy on the LMS. If the text is held on an external website you will be given a URL link allowing you to access the document. All URLs have been checked, however if you find a broken link or missing document please inform the unit coordinator&nbsp;</p><p>Some popular books are held in a special reserved section of the Ried Library. You can find these through the unit's 'Unit Readings' link&nbsp;</p><p>In sum - you have been set a mixture of different readings ranging from book chapters to research papers. Some will be online only and the minority will be offline. You should have plenty of opportunities to read across the unit.</p><p>REMEMBER: You are not expected to read everything - this would be impossible to do in one semester! You will be able to find the reading list for each lecture in the sections below&nbsp;</p><p>NOTE: some materials are being prepared as e documents and will be ready when teaching starts</p></div></p></pre></p>

                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
