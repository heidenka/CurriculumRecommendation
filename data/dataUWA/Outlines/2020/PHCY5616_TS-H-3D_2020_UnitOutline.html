You are required to delve into a patient’s disease state and therapy, beginning at the bedside when possible, documenting and reviewing treatment, with the purpose of understanding the role of the pharmacist in managing the patient and the disease.</p><p>In the process, you will be required to consider quality use of medicines, and to use your knowledge of therapeutics and pharmaceutical science to evaluate the basis for treatment of the patient. Working in pairs, you will be required to give both written and oral reports of every case and practice situation that you examine.</p></p></pre></p>

You will be required to complete approximately 5 hours of online modules prior to attending Placement II Orientation week. An overview of each hospital site will be presented by pharmacist mentors from each hospital during the orientation week. An introduction to hospital pharmacy including an introduction to patient medical records, medication charts, medication reconciliation and hospital-based systems will also be provided during orientation week.</p><p>Students will be required to complete a series of NPS online modules on the National Standard Medication Charts and Medication Safety prior to attending orientation week. Face to face teaching and workshops will take place from Monday 5th October through to Wednesday 7th October as per the timetable and attendance is compulsory. If a student is unable to attend a session they will need to discuss this with the Unit Coordinator. Please note: it is considered professional behaviour to attend all sessions on time.&nbsp;</p><p>Week 1 of placement will start on the <strong>12th of October 2020. </strong></p><p>During the first two rotations, your mentor will provide a good deal of guidance in your analysis of clinical cases and practice reports. There will be less guidance provided and greater expectation of you during the last rotations.<br></p><p><strong>Day 1</strong> of Each Rotation</p><p>The first day in each hospital will include an orientation/information session to familiarise you with processes and requirements of that hospital. It is expected that you understand the processes for identifying and extracting information from case notes using the skills developed during tutorials and workshops in orientation week. Your mentor will explain processes relevant to each hospital. At some time on the first day (morning or afternoon, depending on the hospital) you will begin your clinical/practice exposure; this may be in the morning, with tutorials in the afternoon, or in the afternoons, with the associated tutorials being conducted in the morning of the next day.</p><p>&nbsp;•	One full clinical case report must be submitted as an individual exercise during the final week of placement. See: Assessment Overview for due dates and submission details.</p><p>•	Activities in each hospital will focus on clinical cases, practice experiences selected for you by your mentor in association with the clinical pharmacist and intervention reports/specialty topics. At selected hospitals you may be provided an opportunity to observe or participate in the medication reconciliation process or to shadow a clinical pharmacist. </p><p>•	Working in pairs, clinical cases will usually begin with a visit to a patient on a ward where you will undertake an interview; this will not always be possible, particularly at the Mental Health services sites. The patient case study offers an opportunity to apply pharmacotherapy and drug knowledge in the context of a real patient whilst working in pairs. Case notes and other relevant information will be accessed for preparation of the daily clinical case report. The focus of this activity is on patient-centred care, monitoring and pharmacist interventions.</p><p>•	Practice experience involves observation (and participation where feasible) in an aspect of hospital pharmacy beyond clinical care. Practice reports explain this experience. Practice experience will be as directed by your mentor/assigned hospital pharmacist and completed in allocated pairs. </p><p>•	At selected sites, students will be provided the opportunity to shadow a clinical pharmacist during their clinical practice. There may be opportunity for you to complete and/or observe the medication reconciliation process. The clinical care of patients will be discussed between students and the preceptor and the students will be asked to prepare a clinical intervention report or a reflection on the experience dependent on the hospital site.</p><p>•	Once the clinical case, practice report or intervention reports are prepared, all students in the group assemble (at a predetermined time) for oral presentations and discussion under the direction of your mentor. Presentations will be a joint effort by each student pair and there is an expectation that both students in the group will lead the discussion. Some cases and reports may be short and relatively straight forward, while others may need to be re-visited at another time – this will be managed by your mentor.</p><p>•	A written report (see below for further instructions on written reports) must be handed to your mentor at the completion of your oral presentation for assessment and comment. Your mentor may return the report to you for correction; all revised (if required) electronic versions of written should be submitted to LMS by 5pm at the end of the rotation week. Any visual aids (such as PowerPoint slides) do not need to be submitted to LMS.</p><p>•	One clinical case must be selected by each individual during the hospital placement to be submitted as a Full Clinical Case Report (see Assessment Overview). The Full Clinical Case Report is due on the Monday of the final week of placement, and therefore it is recommended that the clinical case is selected during the first 2 weeks of placement. This is an individual exercise.</p></p></pre></p>

The process in each hospital will be similar, and each hospital has its own strengths/specialities. A pharmacist mentor in each hospital will manage students at all times.<br></p><p>You will rotate weekly through the following hospitals:</p><p>St John of God- Subiaco</p><p>Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital -Nedlands</p><p>King Edward Memorial Hospital- Subiaco</p><p>Grayland's Hospital - Mt Claremont and other sites</p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The focus of this Hospital Placement is on the clinical and operational aspects of hospital pharmacy. Your experience will encompass the provision of clinical and nonclinical pharmacy services in hospital. </p><p>During each rotation week students must complete<br></p><p>•	A minimum of three clinical case studies</p><p>•	A maximum of one practice report</p><p>•	A maximum of one clinical intervention/specialty topic/reflection (selected hospitals)</p><p>During each rotation you will complete clinical case studies and may be given the opportunity to complete, practice reports and/or clinical intervention reports/reflection exercise, as determined by the preceptor. A maximum of ONE practice report and ONE clinical intervention report/reflection can be submitted per hospital site. There is no maximum number of case studies that can be submitted. For example, at some hospital you may be asked to complete five patient case studies during the week, whilst at another hospital you may be asked to submit three patient case studies, one practice report and one clinical intervention.</p><p>Your clinical case oral presentations and practice report presentation should be prepared considering the headings provided in the unit guidebook. All oral presentations are performed in PAIRS, and written reports will differ across sites. See the unit guidebook for guidelines for the oral and written presentations. Please remember you need to reference all of your work where applicable (Vancouver referencing).&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Structure of Feedback</strong><br></p><p>Feedback from your mentor is an ongoing process throughout the unit. When working in pairs, peer feedback is encouraged. Feedback during oral presentations is provided through questioning and discussion. In addition, each mentor will hold weekly focus group discussions throughout the rotations, where you are encouraged to provide robust and honest feedback. One student from each group must record the reflections and send them to the Unit Coordinator at the end of each rotation.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

Master of Pharmacy students are also to refer to guidelines set by the Pharmacy Board of Australia, the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, the Society for Hospital Pharmacists and other pharmacy professional organisations.</p><p>The Professional Behaviour document for Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences Students can be accessed here.</p><p>Management</p><p>All unprofessional behaviour or professional misconduct must be reported. The agreed principles of reporting, investigating and recording unprofessional behavior as outlined in the policy document using the relevant templates will be used in applying these guidelines.</p><p>Governance</p><p>All reported misconduct will be forwarded for review to the Professional Behaviour Advisory Panel (PBAP) who will monitor the reporting and remediation processes applied by Schools.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
