The modules can be accessed through the unit website on UWA's Learning Management System at www.lms.uwa.edu.au. Each online learning module is designed so that you can learn at your own pace and from the comfort of your own home! It is suggested that students complete the online learning modules in accordance with the unit schedule set out below.&nbsp;</div><p>Each online learning module is broken into four sections:&nbsp;</p><p>What is this module about?&nbsp;</p><p>This section gives a general overview of what will be covered in the module.&nbsp;</p><p>Watch it!&nbsp;</p><p>You should start each module by watching the video clips which are intended to guide you through the relevant legislation, case law and readings. Please note that the video clips are not intended to cover every aspect of the course in detail but, instead, are designed to explain key concepts and highlight important issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Read it!&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have watched the video clips, you should complete the required readings which are listed in this section of the module. The readings are intended to cover the finer points of the concepts which may have been discussed in the video clips. These readings will form part of the assessable content for the unit. Most of the readings come from the compulsory text book. However, other readings (including rulings and additional materials) are noted under the module.<br></p><p>Apply it!&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have watched the video clips and completed the readings, you should consolidate your learning by attempting to answer the questions listed in this section of the module. Once you have answered the questions, you can then check how you went by comparing your answers to the Answer Guide. You will also have the opportunity to apply what you have learnt in each module by attending the interactive workshops and tutorials.&nbsp; In addition to the online learning modules, there are a series of interactive workshops which are designed to support you in completing your assessments in this unit. There are two workshops to help you complete the assignment and four workshops to help you prepare for the final exam. Note the workshops that are to help you complete the assignment have been scheduled to ensure that you begin your preparation for the assignment earlier in the semester. Please ensure you have a draft of the assignment completed for the assignment workshop. The interactive workshops are not like "traditional lectures" where there is no student and lecturer interaction. Instead, the workshops will be hands-on, practical and directly relevant to your assessments. The interactive workshops will involve you working together in groups (with the assistance of the lecturer) to complete a variety of tasks relating to the assessments. Given that the interactive workshops are based almost exclusively on group work,<strong> it is not possible to record them</strong> and there are no materials which will be made available online following the workshops. You are therefore strongly encouraged to attend all workshop sessions. If you have a laptop, you are encouraged to bring it with you to the interactive workshops as some activities may involve an online component. More detail about the interactive workshops and what you will be doing in them is available on the LMS site for the unit. The interactive workshops will be held between 3pm and 5pm Social Science Lecture Theatre [G130] on the following dates:&nbsp;</p><p>(1) Workshop 1: Assignment Planning and Writing Skills on 24 Feburary 2020 facilitated by Nicole Wilson-Rogers&nbsp;</p><p>(2) Workshop 2: Mock Exam on Modules 1 to 3 on 16 March 2020 facilitated by Nicole Wilson-Rogers&nbsp;</p><p>(3) Workshop 3: Draft Assignment Feedback and Review on 30 March 2020 facilitated by Nicole Wilson-Rogers&nbsp;</p><p>(4) Workshop 4: Mock Exam on Modules 4 to 6 on 20 April 2020 facilitated by Ian Murray&nbsp;</p><p>(5) Workshop 5: Mock Exam on Modules 7 to 9 on 4 May 2020 facilitated by Ian Murray&nbsp;</p><p>(6) Workshop 6: Mock Exam on Modules 10 to 12 on 18 May 2020 facilitated by Ian Murray. <br></p></p></pre></p>

The workshops in this unit are not recorded given the mode of delivery. Tutorials will be held every week starting from week 2. Please ensure you have enrolled in a tutorial in the Class Allocation System at <a href='http://www.cas.uwa.edu.au' target='_blank' >http://www.cas.uwa.edu.au</a>. The Class Allocation System allows you to select your preferred class time. The system will then assign you to a tutorial based on your preferences. You may then be given an opportunity to change your tutorial time (if an alternative time is available). Unfortunately, the unit coordinators are not able to take requests from students to be allocated to a specific tutorial or to move students to a different class once assigned as we do not have access to the relevant system. If you have a question about your tutorial enrolment, please lodge an enquiry through AskUWA at www.ask.uwa.edu.au and Student Administration should be able assist you.</p></p></pre></p>

You are allowed to miss one tutorial and this will not impact your mark. Tutorials commence in Week 2 (ie. the week beginning 2 March 2020) and will run each week for 45 minutes.</p><p>The tutorials in this unit may be different to other classes you have taken.  Tutorial marks will be based on participation in class so you need to be well prepared and ready to contribute to discussions.  We ask that you come to your tutorial having completed the relevant modules (including required readings) and having attempted the tutorial questions beforehand.</p><p>The marking criteria for tutorial participation marks are as follows:</p><p>(1) demonstrated prior preparation;</p><p>(2) willingness and ability to participate in class discussions and respond to questions;</p><p>(3) quality of contribution to class discussions; and</p><p>(4) clarity and effectiveness of communication.</p><p>There are no marks allocated to simply attending tutorials.</p><p>How do I enrol in a tutorial?</p><p>Please ensure you have enrolled in a tutorial in the Class Allocation System at www.cas.uwa.edu.au. The Class Allocation System allows you to select your preferred class time.  The system will then assign you to a tutorial based on your preferences.  </p><p>Can I change tutorials?</p><p>Up until the end of Week 2 , students will be able to change their own class allocations on the Class Allocation System at www.cas.uwa.edu.au. You will only be able to move yourself into an alternative tutorial where there is a space.  Spaces may change daily according to student movements.  New enrolments can add themselves to classes where there is a space. </p><p>Unfortunately, unit coordinators are not able to take requests from students to be allocated to a specific tutorial or to move students to a different class once assigned as we do not have access to the Class Allocation System.  Please contact your Student Office if you have any issues with the Class Allocation System.</p><p>Can I attend a different class for a week?</p><p>Students are required to attend their assigned class.  Part-time work, social or other commitments are not grounds for attending an alternative class.  In exceptional circumstances, a student will be permitted to attend an alternative class if they have an approved application for special consideration or have an exceptional reason for attending an alternative class (eg. illness) and have obtained the prior permission of the unit coordinator.</p><p>A student who attends an alternative tutorial without prior permission from the unit coordinator will not receive any tutorial marks for that week.</p><p>What happens if I am sick?</p><p>You are allowed to miss one tutorial without any penalty.  If you are unable to attend your assigned tutorial for more than one week, you should apply for special consideration through your faculty.</p><p>Where can I find the tutorial questions?</p><p>The tutorial questions are available on the tutorial section of LMS.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
