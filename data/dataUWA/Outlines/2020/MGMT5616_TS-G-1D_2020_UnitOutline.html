The business community doesn’t always adequately understand the decision making processes in state and federal politics. This unit aims to ensure the business leaders of tomorrow who undertake studies at UWA fully appreciate what factors go into political decision making, as well as the process of policy development which occurs.</p><p>Students are exposed to the bureaucratic processes, the machinations within political parties, and the necessary role of the media. While not all political decisions affect business, most business decision making relies on the governance framework of the nation the business operates within. It is important that anyone seeking to do business within a particular country understands these processes.</p><p>The business of politics unit includes traditional lectures on content which business students often aren’t exposed to but should be. It offers explanations for some of the most significant political decisions which have affected business in recent years: the mining tax during Kevin Rudd’s prime ministership, the repeal of the carbon tax by Tony Abbott’s government, and changes to the industrial relations system from Bob Hawke, to John Howard to Malcolm Turnbull.</p><p>This unit includes guest lectures by high profile ministers from state and federal politics, giving students the opportunity to listen directly to decision makers who shape the policy settings which affect business. Upon completion of this unit students should be able to quickly identify the risks within the political sphere which can undermine business confidence, as well as judge and pre-judge the best response to decisions made by politicians. The unit canvasses issues such as lobbying, pressure groups and the changing nature of political institutions, equipping students who undertake the unit with the tools they need to navigate a domestic and international political climate which has become increasingly volatile.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content.

Additional subject material will be provided</p><p>by the lecturer during each class. Each day there will be experiential</p><p>exercises to reinforce the teaching material and to give students the</p><p>opportunity to develop their interpersonal and debating skills. It is</p><p>anticipated that students will participate fully in the exercises and other</p><p>activities and that they will work within the parameters set for the</p><p>exercises as each exercise had been designed to focus on particular aspects</p><p>of the business of politics. Further, it is expected that students will encourage the</p><p>participation of others in the exercises and activities. To gain the</p><p>maximum benefit from the exercises, students should seek to neither control</p><p>nor ‘hide’. When reviewing exercises and while giving (and receiving)</p><p>feedback, the fundamental purpose is to assist others in the class to gain</p><p>greater understanding of the business of politics. Students should note that there</p><p>will be an emphasis on reflective practice as a key element in the learning</p><p>process both in the classroom and in the assignments. This is not an</p><p>academic exercise for the purposes of getting a mark in the unit –</p><p>reflection is a key skill in life.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

More formally, the University regulations state that ‘to complete a course or unit students shall attend prescribed classes, lectures, seminars and tutorials’. Where a student, due to exceptional circumstances, is unable to attend a scheduled class, they are required to obtain prior approval of the unit coordinator to be absent from that class. Any student absent from class without having had such absence approved by the unit coordinator may be referred to the faculty for advice and may be required to withdraw from the unit.</p></pre></p>

Not everyone will want to invest the time in using this system but you should consider it if you intend to build up resource materials or plan to undertake extensive research in a particular area. The library staff have also developed a tutoring package: A Quick Guide to Using EndNote which provides the basics for using EndNote with an essay <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote' target='_blank' >http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote</a> Acknowledging Sources of Information and the Business School Policy on Plagiarism Student Services provides an online plagiarism portal that includes a definition of plagiarism and a link to FAQ www.studentservices.uwa.edu.au/ss/learning/online_services/plagiarism_portal Turnitin' Originality Checking and Plagiarism Prevention is used in the Faculty to allow both educators and their students check written work for improper citation or misappropriated content.

I realise assessments are of extreme importance to the student cohort.

There will be plenty of flexibility available for students needing it when it comes to the deadlines imposed.&nbsp;</p><p>Biography of unit coordinator:</p><p>Peter van Onselen is the Political Editor at Network Ten, as well as a contributing editor at The Australian newspaper. Peter has conducted live television interviews with the last six Australian Prime Ministers, as well as written a bestselling biography on John Howard, rated by the Wall Street Journal as the best biography of 2007.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>

                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
