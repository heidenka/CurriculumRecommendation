                                    <td>This unit focuses on students developing a mechanistic understanding of the hydrologic, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as a basis for developing solutions to fundamental questions in ecology   and environmental science. For example, how do we predict what happens to rates of nitrogen transformation under a changing climate? How do plant communities respond to alterations in groundwater distribution and availability? What role do termites and ants play in driving nutrient cycles? How do we determine impacts of catchment land use on estuarine food webs or groundwater quality?  Examples are drawn from marine, freshwater, agricultural and other terrestrial ecosystems.  Lectures are complemented by a series of problem-based laboratories where students have the opportunity to learn cutting-edge techniques. The unit poses as many questions as it provides answers. The idea is that, by trying to answer these questions, students develop a mechanistic understanding of biogeochemical cycles and the skills to apply this knowledge to real-world problems.  A core theme for the unit is the way stable isotopes are used as a tool for developing both fundamental and applied understanding of the ecological and hydrological functioning of ecosystems.</td>

                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Welcome to Ecosystem Biogeochemistry for 2019!   We're looking forward to a great time exploring all sorts of adventures in ecology, biology, hydrology and environmental science from a mechanistic (process-based) and elemental perspective.  This unit is all about getting you back to thinking from first principles and also demonstrating that you probably know more than you think you do about how to problem solve. <br></p><p>The nitty gritty...... in ENVT5512 we will examine role of plant communities in cycles of carbon, nutrients and water. We will develop a mechanistic understanding of the processes that drive biogeochemical cycling and underpin ecosystem functioning. The unit encompasses studies of ecological and ecosystem biogeochemistry (e.g. disturbance, nutrient and water budgets, plant and soil chemistry, geochemical and biological interactions) and familiarises students with the most recent advances in research techniques.</p><br><p>This course will pose as many questions as it provides answers. The idea is that by trying to answer these questions you will develop a mechanistic understanding of carbon, nutrient and hydrologic cycles and develop the skills to apply this knowledge to real world problems.</p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>

What happens to CO2 dissolution in our oceans as temperature increases? How do plant communities respond to alterations in groundwater distribution and availability? What role do termites and ants play in driving nutrient cycles?</p><p>The course includes a series of problem-based lab classes where students will have the opportunity to learn cutting edge techniques, in particular the application of stable isotopes to ecological - and hydrological and broader environmental studies.Classes are generally scheduled over 6 weeks, starting at 10 am and finishing at 4 pm<br></p></p></pre></p>

Activities include:</p><p>1. 1 x 2 h training on how to undertake a rigorous search of the scientific literature and exploring current big ideas in isotope-based studies</p><p>2. Field sampling of pond ecosystems for nutrient and biogeochemical analyses (3 h)</p><p>3. 1 x 3 h lab to provide training in soil, water and plant analysis techniques</p><p>4. 1 x 3 h data analysis laboratory - how to approach ecosystem-based data</p><p>5. 1 x 3 h problem solving session<br></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>

UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
