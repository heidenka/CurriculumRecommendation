By fostering an understanding of the theoretical and practical bases out of which music in the community has emerged, the unit provides students with practical experiences that develop a repertoire of reflective practitioner skills for engagement in community music practices. Key questions to be explored include—What are the foundations of the community music movement? What processes are involved in producing musical activities for community music goals? What skills and understandings need to be developed by musicians practicing in various community settings? What are the therapeutic functions and applications of music? How do these processes operate? How can music assist in improving health and wellbeing? 

This is an elective unit in the Music Studies major in the Bachelor of Arts degree. It is also open to students enrolled in other majors and degree pathways who fulfil the prerequisites and who have an interest in music.</td>

By fostering an understanding of the theoretical and practical bases out of which music in the community has emerged, the unit provides students with practical experiences that develop a repertoire of reflective practitioner skills for engagement in community music practices. Key questions to be explored include—What are the foundations of the community music movement? What processes are involved in producing musical activities for community music goals? What skills and understandings need to be developed by musicians practicing in various community settings? What are the therapeutic functions and applications of music? How do these processes operate? How can music assist in improving health and wellbeing? This is an elective unit in the Music Studies major in the Bachelor of Arts degree. It is also open to students enrolled in other majors and degree pathways who fulfil the prerequisites and who have an interest in music.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
                    <p>If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend</li>
                        <li>serious injury</li>
                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
