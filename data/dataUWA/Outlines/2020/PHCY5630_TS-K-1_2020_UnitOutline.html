An emphasis is placed on the student increasing their awareness of the patient as a whole through the concept of patient centred care. 

Pharmacology and pharmacotherapy is presented in an integrated fashion and will provide an in-depth look at the pharmacists' role in the management of major disease states. 

Other topics include drug interactions; therapeutic drug monitoring; laboratory testing and monitoring of results; sources of inter-patient variability in pharmacokinetics, clinical case studies and pharmacokinetics of specific drugs. 

A case-based approach to learning helps student focus is on the key learning objectives. The cases are selected so that they challenge the students' understanding of the topic and provide ground for discussion between the student and the topic tutor. Use of clinically-oriented problems and case studies will enable students to apply principles of pharmacology and pharmacotherapy to real-world examples in preparation for hospital placements.</td>

                    <p>PHCY5630 - Integrated Pharmacology, Therapeutics and Pharmacy Practice 3 - TS-K-1-2020 - 2020 - Face to face / Blended learning</p>
                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Welcome to Integrated Pharmacology, Therapeutics and Pharmacy Practice 3 (IPTAPP 3).  This unit continues to provide detailed pharmacology and pharmacotherapy of major disease states and further expands on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs first introduced to students in PHCY5602 Pharmacy Practice and Pharmacotherapy 1. IPTAPP 3 must be taken alongside PHCY5612 Integrated Pharmacology, Therapeutics and Pharmacy Practice 2 (IPTAPP 2), as the units complement each other. In both units, an emphasis is placed on the student increasing their awareness of the patient as a whole through the concept of patient centred care.</p><p>Pharmacology and pharmacotherapy are presented in an integrated fashion and will provide an in-depth look at the pharmacist’s role in the management of major disease states. Special consideration of monitoring for efficacy and safety of treatment regimens, with emphasis on the development of therapeutic management plans, is included. A case-based approach to learning will ensure that the student focus is on the key learning objectives. The cases are selected so that they challenge the students' understanding of the topic and provide grounds for discussion between the student and the topic tutor.</p><p>Other topics include therapeutic drug monitoring; drug-drug interactions; sources of inter-patient variability in pharmacokinetics, clinical case studies and pharmacokinetics of specific drugs. The use of clinically-oriented problems and cases will enable students to apply these principles to real-world examples in preparation for hospital placements.</p><p>This unit builds on previous units to provide students with an appreciation of the complexities involved with providing health care to patients. Patients are people with lives and experiences, and often more than one health issue to consider. These all impact on the care they require. This is the essence of patient-centred care.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Lecture Capture System</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>In accordance with UWA’s policy on lecture capture all lectures* in enabled venues will be recorded and made available to stream and download by enrolled students via the Lecture Capture System (LCS) for the duration of the unit (including Supplementary and Deferred Examinations period).

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit comprises lectures, workshops, tutorials, self-directed learning and peer assisted learning. Pharmacology content considers both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles and calculations. This is extended through the application of pharmacology concepts to therapeutics, including an introduction to clinical pharmacotherapy across a selection of major disease states. Lecturers will use cases to illustrate their practice area where relevant, and a calculations workshop will be conducted (students will actively work to solve and present calculations to the group). Lectures are recorded and will be available through LMS within one week of the session delivery where possible.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Unit Structure</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>The unit comprises lectures, workshops and tutorials, usually delivered on Mondays and Tuesdays from 9am-12pm each week. A detailed unit schedule is provided via the UWA Learning Management System. It is your responsibility to check the schedule and LMS regularly in case of any changes. There are some important deviations in room and start time during this unit, and some sessions will be held on Wednesdays and potentially Thursdays to accommodate loss of Monday teaching on public holidays. Please make sure you follow the schedule on LMS.&nbsp;</p><p>To pass this unit, a student must: (a) achieve an overall mark of 50 per cent or higher for the unit; and (b) achieve the requisite requirements(s) or a mark of 50 per cent or greater, whichever is higher and specified in the unit outline, for the oral assessment component. The oral assessment (viva voce) is therefore a barrier assessment. This means students must pass the viva voce assessment to pass the unit.<br></p><p>A supplementary viva voce assessment will be available to students who fail to achieve a mark of 50% or greater in the oral assessment component. If offered, this will occur before the end of the trimester period. The supplementary/deferred assessment will be held on: Thursday 23rd April from 1.00pm-4.00pm. A fail in the supplementary/deferred assessment will result in a fail for the unit. </p><p>A supplementary assessment may be offered if a student achieves a final mark of 45 - 49% in PHCY5612 or PHCY5630 but not both.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
