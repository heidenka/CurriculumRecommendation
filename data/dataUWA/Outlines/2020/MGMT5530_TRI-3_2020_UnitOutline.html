Students will compare and contrast healthcare systems and their components, examining the issues and complexities faced, as well as examining best practice examples. Through this comparative analysis of health system attributes and outcomes students will debate the main models and principles of health systems, including public vs private healthcare.

The second component of this unit will enhance students understanding of both local and global health policy through the application of concepts, theories and methods for common issues facing the health sector.  Students will critical analyse common national and international healthcare policy challenges, learn different methodologies for policy development and reform in complex environments and be able to critique policy at a level appropriate for a healthcare leader. 

The third component of this unit focuses on clinical and corporate governance. Students will analyse common governance issues facing healthcare organisations, examine governance models and standards and learn tools and techniques to develop and implement strategies aimed at improving the quality of healthcare organisations. Students will learn strategies aimed at reducing harm, improving consumer engagement and improving the safety and efficiency of healthcare systems and processes through quality improvements tools and techniques.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p><u><strong>Unit content</strong></u></p><p>This unit takes a general perspective and is concerned with setting the future policy direction of the nation and its impact on health care organisations. The most important outcome from undertaking this unit is to learn the changes that are taking place in the healthcare environment; how healthcare managers/leaders can think and act appropriately. </p><p>The unit provides you with the policy related theoretical concepts and their applications to improve the thinking capabilities of students.  Several topics are considered:  What is healthcare?; What is public health?; What is the policy impact on healthcare organisations?; How policy development and reforms happen within the healthcare sector?;  How healthcare financed?; The role of universal public health insurance (Medicare) and private health insurance.</p><p><u><strong>The Goal of the unit</strong></u></p><p>The most important outcome is that you are able to think about the complexities surrounding the healthcare organisations and act strategically.  Overall, the course aims to improve the practice of healthcare policy management and healthcare organisations, i.e. your ability to manage a variety of policy and governance situations within the healthcare settings.  These situations may be complicated, and you should be able to cope with a considerable amount of ambiguity, including constant shifting of policies.  The aim of the course is to introduce students to:</p><p>•	The importance of stakeholders and how they interact and shape the healthcare system of the nation.</p><p>•	Formulation of public health policy and its implications on health care organisations.</p><p>•	Analysis of various healthcare services including primary healthcare system, acute-care system, and the allied healthcare sector. </p><p>•	Understanding health care financing: tax-based universal health insurance (Medicare), private health insurance, and other sources.</p><p>•	The roles of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in the health system.</p><p>•	The role and responsibilities of various levels of governments in the implementation of policies and management of healthcare delivery.</p><p>•	The importance of clinical governance: quality, safety and access to health care.</p><p>•	Able to understand the digitisation of the healthcare system and value creation, including electronic medical records, and the changes that are taking place in access to physicians and specialists.</p><p>•	Comparative health systems among a few selected countries.</p><p>•	Aspects of healthcare leadership at top levels of the organisation.</p><p>The unit perspective is that of the entire organisation/department, usually as seen from the position of a general manager/clinical-business manager, policy director, health department manager and/or managing director/CEO. However, the topic is also of interest to all levels of management; physicians, nurses, policymakers and as well as staff and the advisers. These people are affected by and in turn, influence the way the healthcare providers deliver cost-effective and value-based healthcare services.  </p><p>With a more active approach, you will learn far more than a few theories and interesting statistics, and this will serve you well in understanding the healthcare system of the nation, and its policies and governance.  Therefore, you are required to pre-read and prepare well for seminar sessions, attend and participate actively in those sessions and hand in assignments on time and doing your fair share of work in team/group projects.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

Therefore, students must prepare and read in advance the relevant concepts, textbook chapters and articles assigned to the seminar. </p><p>The study pack has designed to facilitate the learning that includes the reading package with relevant journal articles and textbook chapters related to the healthcare system.</p><p>Students are encouraged to share their (or their colleagues/friends) healthcare business experiences, of successful and/or not so successful strategies, in the classroom.  Students will have frequent opportunities to work as an individual and in groups to apply their understanding of concepts while developing their assignments.</p><p>The<u> individual policy analysis paper</u>: You are required to prepare a detailed policy analysis paper on one of the topics, of your choice, given below:</p><p>•	Aged care policy.</p><p>•	Child and youth health.</p><p>•	Child dental health policy.</p><p>•	Child immunisation.</p><p>•	Chronic diseases (e.g. Child and adult obesity, Back and Spine care, etc.)</p><p>•	Infectious diseases.</p><p>•	Healthy living.</p><p>•	Indigenous health.</p><p>•	Men’s health (e.g. prostate cancer screening).</p><p>•	Mental health and suicide prevention.</p><p>•	Palliative care.</p><p>•	Preventative health care.</p><p>•	Remote and rural health policy.</p><p>•	Smoke and tobacco usage.</p><p>•	Substance use and rehabilitation.</p><p>•	Women’s health (e.g. breast cancer screening).</p><p>•	Your choice of the topic if not listed above (please discuss).</p><p>The <u>individual policy analysis</u> paper must include the following:</p><p>•	The historical overview and key events that have influenced the development of today’s policy of your selected topic.</p><p>•	The determinants of health (socioeconomic, behavioural, biological, environmental, etc.), having an impact on the health of individuals and populations across the life span, and among different cultural groups.</p><p>•	Critical evaluation of public health policy interventions at the appropriate time.</p><p>•	How effectively the policy criteria have been communicated to the populations and finally implemented.</p><p>•	Analysis of the funding source for the selected topic. Its effective implementation and the role and the responsibilities of various levels of governments. </p><p>•	Critique any barriers that the health policy has encountered during its implementation (e.g. political interference, key stakeholder lobbying, etc.).</p><p>•	Evaluate the applicability of analytical methods, empirical data, and commonly used policy frameworks. Provide your recommendations to adopt different approaches for developing and implementing the cost-effective public policy of your selected topic (both in terms of population health and health care expenditure).</p><p>The individual policy analysis paper provides you with an opportunity to develop your thought process and strategies based on critical analyses of current policy. You are able to think through alternative ways to improve policies and recommendations to the policymakers for the sustainability of national health policy.</p><p>The<u> learning journal/diary</u> is meant to capture your process of learning.  You are required to keep and maintain an on-going learning journal/diary that capture's your process of reflective thinking and learning throughout this unit.  Help to ensure that you will be an active participant and also help you to apply your knowledge and experiences, particularly when reflecting upon the materials.  </p><p>The <u>group/team project </u>provides an opportunity for more in-depth investigation where participants will benefit from further research of additional sources to strengthen their analysis.  The team/group assignment based on developing a case study on any of the policy area of your choice. The team project choice may be from any service area. For example; Disability and aged care, child immunisation, men and women’s health care, policy issues on private health insurance, clinical and corporate governance, pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The topic may be selected from the current working area of the student, or have been working, or they have worked in the past. The final case study report must include various healthcare environmental issues that the provider or the department is facing and analysing your case study to formulate appropriate recommendations.</p></p></pre></p>

An essential feature of the course is an emphasis on perspective and developing one's point of view.  </p><p>Students expected to spend an average of 6-8 hours individually and in their groups preparing for each class session.  <u>Successful learning on the course depends very much on you reading the material, to adequately prepare the cases and to have a constructive discussion of issues in your groups and the class.</u>  To paraphrase Frances Bacon: <strong>“reading makes a person full, writing makes a person precise, and debate makes a person prepared.”</strong></p><p>You will have to deal with quite many different ideas – sometimes they agree with each other, sometimes they don't.  You will be given concepts/frameworks and support to help you to integrate the different perspectives you will come across. It is also essential that you exercise your mind to make sense of or accept, these differences in your way so that you develop your own thinking and views.</p><p>This course uses a variety of learning methods, including theoretical concepts, classroom and group discussions of both theory and practical application, and knowledge gained from guest lecturers who are active in the health care sector. Therefore, attendance and participation in class sessions are an essential part of the learning process and the functioning of the course.</p><p>The course consists of 12 sessions; each session is about 3.0 hours. The unit structure consists of:</p><p>1)	A selection of a few journal articles/readings supplement to the textbook,</p><p>2)	A collection of essential concepts/theory from the textbook chapters, and</p><p>3)	Guest speakers from the health care industry.</p><p>On completion of this unit, you should be able to:</p><p>•	Have a deeper understanding of healthcare policy and the importance of various stakeholders in shaping the healthcare system of the nation.</p><p>•	Have a deeper understanding of the funding system for healthcare.</p><p>•	Have a clear understanding of the governance structure of the health care system.</p><p>•	Have experience in the application of theory/concepts and your work experience to several policy issues and readings.</p></p></pre></p>

Where a student, due to exceptional circumstances, is unable to attend a scheduled class, they are required to obtain prior approval of the unit coordinator to be absent from that class. Any student absent from class without having had such absence approved by the unit coordinator may be referred to the faculty for advice and may be required to withdraw from the unit.</p></p></pre></p>

The Harvard style is the preferred used unless otherwise stated by the unit coordinator. There are some notes for guidance which have been prepared by the library staff: ‘Citing your Sources Harvard Style’ . The EndNote software package is a really good system for building up a database of references. Not everyone will want to invest the time in using this system but you should consider it if you intend to build up resource materials or plan to undertake extensive research in a particular area. The library staff have also developed a tutoring package: ‘A Quick Guide to Using EndNote’ which provides the basics for using EndNote with an essay <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote' target='_blank' >http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote</a> Acknowledging Sources of Information and the Business School Policy on Plagiarism: Student Services provides an online plagiarism portal that includes a definition of plagiarism and a link to FAQ www.studentservices.uwa.edu.au/ss/learning/online_services/plagiarism_portal ‘Turnitin' Originality Checking and Plagiarism Prevention is used in the Faculty to allow both educators and their students check written work for improper citation or misappropriated content.

The assessable tasks are designed to encourage you to explore and understand the subject more fully. The fact that we grade your work provides you with an indication of how much you have achieved. Providing feedback on your work also serves as part of the learning process.</p><p><u>Assessment mechanism summary</u></p><p>Assignment-1: Class participation.<br></p><p>Class participation On-going	Students are NOT allowed to miss more than two (2) sessions during the term unless they present adequate documentary evidence to justify their absence.</p><p>Assignment-2a: Individual Policy Analysis Paper<br></p><p>Individual Policy Analysis Paper due for submission on 6th Oct 2020 before 5.00 pm.</p><p>Assignment-2b:&nbsp;Individual learning journal/diary</p><p>Individual learning journal/diary due for submission on 11th Nov 2020 before 5.00 pm.</p><p>Assignment-3:&nbsp;Team/Group project report:</p><p>Team/Group project report: Developing a case on an organisation and providing an analysis report with recommendations due for submission on 17th Nov 2020 before 5.00 pm.</p><p><u>Notes:</u></p><p>Note 1:	Results may be subject to scaling and standardisation under faculty policy and are not necessarily the sum of the component parts.</p><p>Note 2: 	The grade FC indicates a failure to complete an identified essential assessment component and means a failure of the unit. </p><p>Note 3:	Your assessed work may also be used for quality assurance purposes, such as to assess the level of achievement of learning outcomes as required for accreditation and audit purposes. The findings may be used to inform changes aimed at improving the quality of Business School programs. All material used for such processes will be treated as confidential, and the outcome will not affect your grade for the unit.</p><p><u>Assessment components</u></p><p><strong>Assignment 1:  Class participation </strong></p><p>Healthcare system, policies and governance unit is as much about healthcare and public policy, and leadership as knowledge of content.  Attendance and participation in-class activities and discussions are essential in developing these abilities.  The marks will be awarded after considering the following.</p><p>•	Attendance means arriving and leaving the class on time.  Attendance will be recorded at every session.  Please inform us if you have a valid reason for missing a class.  If you do miss a class, you will be required to prepare notes to show that you have undertaken the preparation.</p><p>•	Participation in class, whether it is listening to a lecture or getting involved in other activities, is an integral part of the learning process.  It is, therefore, vital that you attend classes (and be on time).</p><p>Participation in discussions is harder to measure but essential to this unit.  While minimum participation in discussion is required, we have a broad view of participation, including evidence of prior preparation, alertness and following the flow of class discussions, active and naturally, effective participation in syndicates and class discussions (a thoughtful comment based on good preparation and judgement is worth much more than superficial remarks).</p><p>Two or more missed classes without prior permission from the lecturer is classified as unsatisfactory.  Students should not expect to obtain approval to miss more than six hours of class time per unit unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p><p>More formally, the University regulations state that ‘to complete a course or unit a student shall attend prescribed classes, lectures seminars and tutorials.  Students whose attendance at MBA units has been unsatisfactory will not be granted a passing grade.</p><p><strong>Assignment item # 2a: Individual Research-based Policy Analysis Paper</strong></p><p>Prepare a critical policy analysis paper in which you analyse a selected topic in determining the effective policy implementation currently being used in terms of population health and potential recommended strategies.</p><p>The key to receiving high marks for this assignment is the analysis that you present regarding the important policy issues facing both the health system and implication on healthcare firms.  </p><p>Your assignment should use academic policy frameworks/models and include references from readings and other case studies covered.  The report shall not be more than 2,000 words (excluding abstract, the reference list, exhibits and annexes) should be typed using 1.5 or double spacing with reasonable side margins.  </p><p>The abstract shall not be more than 300 words.   Refer to the word limit and late submission penalties in the section below.</p><p>As always, q<u>uality is more important than quantity</u>.  The depth of analysis is paramount in this assignment.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong><b style="">:&nbsp;</strong></p><p> At the end of this assignment, you will:</p><p>•	Be able to view the importance of public health policy and impact on healthcare organisations and stakeholders, long-term prospects, and how it relates and interacts with various forces in its national environment.</p><p>•	Have learnt to pick up the symptoms of the current public health policy.</p><p>•	Have developed the capabilities of the diagnostic process for evaluating the issues that the public health face and its influence on health care businesses.</p><p>•	Have a deeper understanding and application of public health policy formulation, communication and implementation strategies.</p><p>•	Have the skills for analysis of changing demographics, chronic health conditions and identification of long-term healthcare trends and disruptive changes.</p><p>•	Understand the aspects of strategic leadership at the top levels of the organisations, including policymakers and regulators.</p><p><strong>Assignment 2b: Individual Learning Journal/Diary</strong></p><p>You are required to keep and maintain an on-going learning journal/diary that capture's your process of reflective learning throughout this unit.  This will ensure that you will be an active participant and will also help you to apply your knowledge and experiences, particularly when reflecting upon the materials.</p><p>Within your Learning Journal / Diary, you need to identify (at least) 10 key lessons learnt from the unit, including your rationale for choosing each of them.  Your Learning Journal / Diary might include: </p><p>1)	Key learning points from journal articles and textbook chapters, and videos, etc.</p><p>2)	How might you have applied the healthcare policy and governance models/ frameworks/theory during your past work experience?  How might you apply them currently?  How could you apply them in the future?</p><p>3)	What evidence of policy outcomes have you observed in the articles and textbook chapters and the videos?  What was not managed well?  Why not?  How might you have accomplished the situation differently? </p><p>4)	What changes you might experience health care delivery in the future? And how these changes disrupt the current delivery model and its impact on health care policy?</p><p>Do note that the Learning journal/diary is meant to capture YOUR process of learning.  It has to be far more than just a re-presentation of student comments made during class discussions.  In-depth analysis and reflective thinking are required relating to you as a health care leader/manager/policymaker – past, present and future.</p><p>This assignment will be assessed according to several criteria such as depth of analysis; healthcare insight; quality reflective thinking; the ability of the student to relate course materials to his / her role as a manager of a healthcare organisation.</p><p>The maximum word length for the Learning Journal / Diary is 20 typed pages.  These page limits do not include tables or figures or appendices.  You can write/present this assignment in any format/structure you prefer.  It is expected that for an assignment of this nature, a very high-quality piece of work will be produced.  The format of the submission should be 12 pt fonts with 1.5 lines spacing.  More than the maximum limit of pages suggested above will be penalised 5% per page in excess.  Refer to the word limit and late submission penalties in the section below. </p><p><strong>Assignment 3: Team/Group Project – A Written Report</strong></p><p>Develop and Analyse a Case Study. Each group will comprise 4-5 students and are required to develop a case study on a selected healthcare policy area.  Your report must have two sections:</p><p><i><u>Section 1: Develop a Case Study</u></i></p><p>The case study may be developed by collecting the information directly contacting the healthcare policy department and/or sourcing the publicly available information about the selected policy area (No word limit for the case study, however, as a guideline you may develop around 20-25 pages.</p><p>The case study on a selected policy area; brief introduction of major policy issues, current situation and its outcomes, funding arrangement, and the availability of healthcare professionals. You must select a time frame for the case study (say last 5-10 years) and identify the critical issues the policymakers have encountered and the implementation strategies used. Further, you need to end the case at a crucial point of time that the readers of policymakers must make some sort of strategic decisions.</p><p><i><u>Section 2: Policy Analysis Report.</u></i></p><p>This section contains an Executive Summary and the policy analysis for the case study developed in Section 1 above.</p><p>•	An executive summary, not exceeding 750 words, accurately summarising all the key points of the report, and any background or introduction as necessary.</p><p>•	The analysis shall be based on the team/group interpretation, which includes the evaluation of the policy process used by the policymakers at different periods. Identify the critical issues faced by various players in the health sector.  </p><p>•	You are required to analyse the case study and justify your arguments using appropriate theoretical concepts/models applicable. You will be encouraged to use the models from the course to see how and if they fit, and which ones best explain the processes observed. The case analysis should be the results of the team’s interpretation, not just that of one individual.</p><p>•	It should be around 2,000 words, excluding exhibits and references. </p><p><strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of this assignment, you will:</p><p>•	Have the skills in developing a policy document.</p><p>•	Have the skills in putting together relevant information that is necessary for a specific policy area.</p><p>•	Have developed to view the broader implications of your policy.</p><p>•	Have the research and writing skills in developing a case study that will have an implication for the health department and its sustainability.</p><p>•	Have developed skills to develop strategies to source funding for the implementation of your policy.</p><p><strong>Late submission of Assignments</strong></p><p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted.
