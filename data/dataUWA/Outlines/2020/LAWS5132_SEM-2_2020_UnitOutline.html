                                    <td>This unit provides an overview of the law and principles of income taxation in Australia. Taxation is ubiquitous in almost all areas of life, not least because it is the key source of public revenue thereby enabling government expenditure, as well as providing a tool for government to influence behaviour, from birth to death. Given the economic, social and political ramifications, any student who wishes to practice as a lawyer or work in business, government, or the not-for-profit sector is well advised to have at least a broad understanding of the Australian taxation system: its sources, functions, content, limits and administration; as well as a theoretical basis to evaluate the system. 

The unit intends to introduce students to these principles in the context of the Australian income tax system; to provide an introduction to the international context of the Australian income tax system; to help students hone the core skills of statutory interpretation and case analysis by applying the content of income tax law to standard transactions; and to provide students with a foundational knowledge of key income tax concepts such as assessable income, deductions and allowances, tax accounting rules for timing and character recognition, and taxable entities. It also engages with current research, comparative perspectives and recent developments in the law to critique the tax system and the tax reform process.</td>

                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit provides an overview of the law and principles of income taxation in Australia. Taxation is ubiquitous in almost all areas of life, not least because it is the key source of public revenue thereby enabling government expenditure, as well as providing a tool for government to influence behaviour, from birth to death. Given the economic, social and political ramifications, any student who wishes to practice as a lawyer or work in business, government, or the not-for-profit sector is well advised to have at least a broad understanding of the Australian taxation system: its sources, functions, content, limits and administration; as well as a theoretical basis to evaluate the system.</p><p>The unit intends to introduce students to these principles in the context of the Australian income tax system; to provide an introduction to the international context of the Australian income tax system; to help students hone the core skills of statutory interpretation and case analysis by applying the content of income tax law to standard transactions; and to provide students with a foundational knowledge of key income tax concepts such as assessable income, deductions and allowances, tax accounting rules for timing and character recognition, and taxable entities. It also engages with current research, comparative perspectives and recent developments in the law to critique the tax system and the tax reform process.</p></p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Lecture Capture System</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>In accordance with UWA’s policy on lecture capture all lectures* in enabled venues will be recorded and made available to stream and download by enrolled students via the Lecture Capture System (LCS) for the duration of the unit (including Supplementary and Deferred Examinations period).

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Achieving the learning outcomes for this unit is a joint endeavour of all participants in the class, including lecturers and students. Accordingly, the workshops will provide you with a framework to understand the key principles of the topics  covered, as well as an opportunity to explore some of the trickier and topical issues. The workshops will also enable you to revise, contextualise and apply the legal and policy principles.</p><p>The JD curriculum has been purposefully designed to scaffold sequential knowledge and skills progression, and may be completed in three years full-time or on a part-time basis. Those who undertake external work, travel or sporting commitments are expected to plan these around their studies. Except in exceptional circumstances, these commitments are not accepted as grounds for a variation in the prescribed sequence of units,* or as valid reasons for timetable changes, the waiving of pre-requisites or variation from the prescribed course structure.* In making a decision as to whether to complete the JD on a full or part-time basis, students must be aware that the estimated time commitment for a standard full-time enrolment is approximately 40 hours per week (over each 12 week semester), excluding examinations. Each unit, including intensive units in non-standard teaching periods, requires an overall time commitment of 150 hours.</p><p>* Students accepted into the UWA Elite Athletes Program, or who undertake exchange or other commitments which involve official representation of the Law School or the University, may seek approval from the Deputy Head of School (Students) for a variation in the prescribed course structure.</p></p></pre></p>

The workshops will be held each week on Fridays from 11am to 1.45pm in the Webb Lecture Theatre.&nbsp;</p><p>Each workshop will be comprised of a formal lecture component interspersed with problem questions and practical group work activities. &nbsp;The lecture component of these workshops will be recorded in case you are unable to attend class in exceptional circumstances. However, this unit is offered in face-to-face mode and listening to recordings should not be viewed as a substitute for attending class.  Moreover, as the workshops will involve practical group work activities, discussions and problem solving, it will not be possible to capture these parts of the workshop using the lecture recording facilities. &nbsp;You are therefore strongly encouraged to attend all workshops in person.&nbsp;</p><p>We may, on occasion, set tasks which you will need to complete before a workshop. &nbsp;Please ensure you complete these tasks so that you get the most out of each workshop.</p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that the workshop recordings will be successful on every occasion. We will not be re-recording workshops should a recording fail.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
