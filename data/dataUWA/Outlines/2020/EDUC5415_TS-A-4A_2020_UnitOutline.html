Written texts should be appropriately structured and clear in meaning.  Correct and appropriate grammar, vocabulary and spelling should be used throughout. Referencing should conform to APA style.  Written literacy and referencing expectations will normally be incorporated into assignment rubrics.</p><p>ASSIGNMENT ONE – TUTORIAL PRESENTATION (30%)</p><p>APST Standard 6 – Engage in professional learning - APTS Standard 7 – Engage professionally with colleagues, parents/carers and the community</p><p>In this assignment you are required to make a fifteen minute tutorial presentation comprising five main headlines from one tutorial theme covered in the Unit. The content of the presentation should be based on recommended readings for the theme in question, as well as any other resources that may be deemed relevant. The exposition will normally be presented by a small group as organised during the first tutorial. In the preparation of your presentation, it is important to take into account the following requirements. A demonstrated understanding of theories, concepts, and ideas in connection with the relevant theme; an ability to engage listeners through attention-getting ideas, adequate volume in your speaking voice, eye contact and gestures; establishing clarity around the main messages; providing a clear introduction, body and conclusion; and adhering to the time frame.</p><p>ASSIGNMENT TWO – CASE STUDY (70%)</p><p>APST Standard 6 – Engage in professional learning</p><p>This assignment comprises a case study analysed according to at least two key themes emerging from the Unit and from the relevant literature. The case is intended to be a real account of a problematic situation/event/experience (relating to Educational Leadership) in a school/educational organization that is written to facilitate analysis, interpretation and learning. It may be 1-2 pages in length and, ideally, it should be crafted from personal observations. Alternatively, you may like to write briefer, more concise cases for several aspects of Educational Leadership encountered in the Unit.</p><p>The case should consist of a one or two page third-person narrative or first-person account of a scenario that may have been resolved, partially resolved or not resolved at all. Whatever the format of the account it should exhibit the following characteristics: a) Have a plot – a beginning, a middle and an end and involve some tension that must be relieved; b) Be situated in an actual context and time frame; c) Be particular and specific rather than containing statements that are generally true; d) Recall the workings of human minds, motives frustrations and misconceptions; e) Reflect the social and cultural context in which events occur (Shulman, 1992).</p><p>You might consider the following framework to structure your analytical commentary accompanying the case(s): a) A brief rationale (for selecting a particular scenario as represented by the case account(s); b) A brief description of context (context of the school, organizational concerns, etc); c) Discussion (a description of what is taking place in the case account and your interpretation of events as it relates to at least two themes covered in the unit, eg, teacher leadership, dealing with a process of change. It is also imperative to link your interpretation with the academic literature); d) Reflection (How might your reflection on practice inform a process of improvement?).</p><p>It is particularly important that your case study contains a clear definition of the issues observed; a clear and detailed description of observations made in relation to the issues; a critical and reflective engagement with the issues in question; a familiarity with relevant scholarly literature; and an adherence to the conventions of academic writing.</p><p>AUSTRALIAN PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR TEACHERS</p><p>Unit Outcome 1: (1) understand key concepts pertinent to the field of educational leadership and management</p><p>APST outcomes: 7.2</p><p>Assessed in: presentation</p><p>Unit Outcome 2: apply concepts of educational leadership and management to personal experiences and practices through a process of reflection and discussion</p><p>APST outcomes: 7.2, 7.4</p><p>Assessed in: case study</p><p>Unit Outcome 3: consider strategies to improve complex educational organisations and reflect on the values that underpin them</p><p>APST outcomes: 7.1, 7.2</p><p>Assessed in: case study</p><p>Unit Outcome 4: develop skills and knowledge relevant to practitioner research</p><p>APST outcomes: 6.2, 6.4</p><p>Assessed in: case study</p><p>RESUBMISSION RULE</p><p>Failure to pass an assessment item within a unit (MTeach)</p><p>Students must pass all components of a Master of Teaching unit to pass the unit overall.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
                    <p>If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend</li>
                        <li>serious injury</li>
                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
