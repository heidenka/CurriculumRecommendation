To respond to these changes organisations are employing diverse supply chain strategies as a source of competitive advantage. This subject is aimed at developing an understanding of the core principles, concepts and approaches employed in the management of operations and supply chains between industrial, commercial, and governmental organisations. Strategic issues relevant to the management of supply chains are covered, including the procurement of materials and management of supplier relationships, information and technological innovation, strategies for cost-savings, time-to- market, new product development and configuration of logistics networks.

Unit content:

The functional area of operations is one that is directly responsible for manufacturing products or generating services in an organisation. It is concerned with the transformation process how the resources of an organisation are utilised to produce the required product or service. The manner in which a company manages these operations, producing their products or services cheaper, better or quicker, is often a primary source of competitive advantage.
The management of supply chains has grown more complex with increasing globalisation and rapid evolutionary changes in technology, managerial philosophies and techniques. Many of the key techniques so common throughout industry today for product and service design, quality management and control, inventory management, etc. need to be viewed in the context of more recent phenomena, such as global operations, supply chains, virtual and e-operations, lean operations, and mass customisation.
This subject will also focus on contemporary challenges and opportunities facing organisations and business leaders in effectively managing their operations. Students will be shown how to use a range of tools and techniques to analyse manufacturing or service operations and learn to develop possible courses of action. The subject will take a numeric analytical perspective as well as a descriptive qualitative approach. Students will be expected to calculate and manipulate data as well as interpret the results in order to derive appropriate solutions to typical operations and supply chain management problems.

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content.

The exercises in this unit are interactive, in which you make a real contribution by asking questions and providing reflections on comments from other discussion participants. Our objective is to foster a learning environment where all students feel comfortable in asking questions when they require clarification about an issue or principle.

Teaching and Learning Evaluation:

You may be asked to complete two evaluations during this unit: The Student Perception of Teaching (SPOT) and the Students’ Unit Reflective Feedback (SURF). The SPOT is optional and is an evaluation of the lecturer and the unit. The SURF is completed online and is a university wide survey and deals only with the unit. You will receive an email from the SURF office inviting you to complete the SURF when it is activated. We encourage you to complete the forms as your feedback is extremely important and can be used to make changes to the unit or lecturing style when appropriate.</p></pre></p>

More formally, the University regulations state that to complete a course or unit students shall attend prescribed classes, lectures, seminars and tutorials. Where a student, due to exceptional circumstances, is unable to attend a scheduled class, they are required to obtain prior approval of the unit coordinator to be absent from that class. Any student absent from class without having had such absence approved by the unit coordinator may be referred to the faculty for advice and may be required to withdraw from the unit.

Business case analysis is an interactive student centred learning experience. Students are expected to demonstrate high levels of preparation and learning via participation in classroom facilitated discussions. Accordingly each students participation mark is derived from a combination of 1. Completing the pre-case questions provided, 2. Contribution to the case discussion in class and 3. From all other non-graded activities such as in-class activities. The following questions may serve as a helpful guide with regard to how 
participation marks are derived:

1. How well prepared is the student?
2. Does the student participate and listen actively throughout the discussion?
3. To what extent does the student contribute ideas, analysis, and personal experiences instead of simply presenting case facts?
4. Does the student build effectively on the comments of others?
5. Does the student think beyond this unit and develop insights through linkages across units?
6. Did the student complete all pre-case questions with high quality?
7. Did the student engage and participate in all in-class activities?</p></pre></p>

The EndNote software package is a really good system for building up a database of references.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
