Building on the foundations delivered in PHCY5610 Physical Pharmacy and Biopharmaceutics, this unit brings students through the formulation and production of major solid, semi-solid, liquid, aerosolised and controlled release drug formulations. Students are provided with an overview of common pharmaceutical excipients, and the principles for preservation, sterilisation and packaging of medicinal products. Tutorials require students to apply the formulation principles to discuss and resolve issues in case-based medicinal product development. The preparation of some medicinal products is undertaken in the laboratory with emphasis on both the science and art of extemporaneous compounding within legislative and professional practice frameworks. Students are also provided opportunities to visit TGA-approved, Perth-based manufacturing facilities of medicinal products. The focus, as in all the pharmacy units, is on the delivery of optimum patient care.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>PHCY5611 Medicinal Product Formulation is a 6-point unit that introduces the principles and processes of medicinal product formulation and production. It builds on the foundations delivered in PHCY5610 Physical Pharmacy and Biopharmaceutics and brings you through the formulation, production and evaluation of major solid, semi-solid, liquid, aerosolized and controlled release drug formulations. The lectures also provide an overview of common pharmaceutical excipients, and the principles for Good Manufacturing Practice, preservation, sterilization and packaging of medicinal products. Tutorials require you to apply the formulation principles to discuss and resolve issues in case-based medicinal product development. Site visits to TGA-approved manufacturing facilities (pending approval) allow you to observe the preparations of sterile and non-sterile pharmaceutical products, as well as cytotoxic products, under Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines. The preparation of some medicinal products is undertaken in the laboratory with emphasis on both the science and art of extemporaneous compounding within legislative and professional practice frameworks. The focus, as in all the pharmacy units, is on the delivery of optimum patient care.</p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content.

To relate theory to practice, cases are used extensively in the lectures, tutorials, practicals and assessments, and every effort is being made to enable you to visit a pharmaceutical manufacturing site in 2020. The practical sessions provide an introduction to the extemporaneous compounding of medicinal products, a competency unique to the practice of pharmacy. These sessions allow you to acquire essential skills in information retrieval, written documentation, packaging and labelling of medicinal products, and the techniques of compounding according to the art of pharmacy. In line with the focus on patient care, there will be an emphasis on compliance with professional and legal requirements, accuracy and other quality control measures in the compounding of the medicinal products.&nbsp;</p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
