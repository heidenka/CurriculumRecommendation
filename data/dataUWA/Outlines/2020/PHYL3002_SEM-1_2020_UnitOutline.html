The unit builds on the material covering cardiovascular and respiratory function in Level 2 PHYL2001 Physiology of Human Body Systems. The unit further develops students' laboratory techniques for physiological measurement. Human experimental work covers non-invasive cardiovascular and respiratory measurements. Ethical aspects of human experimentation are covered. 

Finally the unit has a focus on data recording, analysis and presentation skills including statistical analysis, the graphical presentation of data, and communication in the form of scientific poster presentations. The unit has a major focus on visual communication of data and critical information literacy in the form of a research poster which students must pose, based on a published paper. The theme of visual communication is continued with the ongoing submission of professional quality figures and graphics using the data generated in laboratory classes. The unit also reinforces aspects of teamwork and interpersonal skills in both experimental work and communication.</td>

                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>‘Physiology of the Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems’ is a third year unit comprising a series of lecture and laboratory sessions that aim to develop in students an understanding of these key physiological functions, and the scientific process via which our understanding of those systems arose. The unit builds on the material covering cardiovascular and respiratory function in level 2 physiology, building towards more advanced topics. Key topics will include; vascular reactivity, hydraulic control of cardiac output as described by vascular function curves, cardiac arrhythmia, the control of ventilation, causes of hypoxia, and the effects of ventilation perfusion inequality. The unit further develops students' laboratory techniques for physiological measurement. The unit has a focus on data recording, analysis and presentation skills including statistical analysis, the graphical presentation of data, and communication in the form of scientific presentations.</p></p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Lecture Capture System</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>In accordance with UWA’s policy on lecture capture all lectures* in enabled venues will be recorded and made available to stream and download by enrolled students via the Lecture Capture System (LCS) for the duration of the unit (including Supplementary and Deferred Examinations period).

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>The Unit includes live lectures which are recorded and cover the core physiology concepts covered by the unit. Attendance of lectures is not compulsory and they are recorded by the LCS. Skills in human physiological experiments and data analysis are taught using tutorials and lab classes. All labs are on humans meaning the student use each other as the test subjects. Lab classes are compulsory and student cannot submit a report for a lab class if they did not attend the lab, unless the student has an approved special consideration. Tutorials cover the skills content such as data analysis and safety aspects of human experimentation they do not focus on the lecture content. Some supplemental video lectures are included on LMS to help students with data analysis and statistics. <br></p><p class="">The assignments in this unit are structured around a scientific conference poster session. Each of the 4 lab classes has a report that is a part of a scientific poster and becomes more complete as the unit progresses. The major assignment is a group project to present a published paper as if it was your experiment in a simulated conference poster session. Report marks are significantly influenced by communications skills, in this case the visual communications skills of making professional level figures and graphs. Student's knowledge of the subject is mostly assessed with the exam. The assignments test what you can do the exam test what you know.<br></p><p class=""><br></p></p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Unit Structure</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p class="">There are 2 lectures per week (some exceptions from public holidays), 3 tutorials over the unit covering skill such as poster production, human experimentation safety and data analysis. The 4 lab classes cover 2 aspects of cardiac and respiratory physiology and are used for the student to show they can analyses and present data in the style of a conference poster. A workshop in week one covers how to use Excel to preform statistical analysis including Fisher's F-test for equal variance, ANOVA and the Bonferroni post hoc test. The seminar session in the final week is a simulated conference poster session in which student's present a published paper on some aspect of cardiovascular or respiratory physiology as if it was their experiment presented at a conference. The poster is a full A0 sized poster printed by the School (i.e. we pay) delivers as a 2 min presentation with 5 min question time to simulate a conference poster presentation session at a conference. The poster and presentation are group projects and pear marking is used in the poster assessment. The lab reports are intended to build towards the major assignment, the poster presentation. The only continuous assessment item not directly attached to making a scientific poster it the statistics tests, which is about analyzing the data that would go onto a conference presentation. The Stats test is online and more of a short assignment than a test.<br></p><p class="">Lab classes have pre-lab videos and quizzes so that students understand what they are doing before attending the lab class. The pre-lab quizzes must be completed before you can hand in the lab report but they do not contribute to your mark they are to make sure you know what you are doing before going to the lab. <br></p></p></pre></p>

Lectures and tutorials are not compulsory, however, the tutorials were added because students felt they needed more help and have reported that the tutorials have helped with the reports and final poster assignment. If a student cannot attend their normal lab class but can attend a different session e.g. cannot do Wed am but can make the Thur am class that week then, on a once only basis, the student can attend the other time slot but should contact the demonstrator of their normal class to let them know. If you are sick and miss a lab or have to miss a class of other good reason you need to obtain a special consideration from the faculty and your due date can then be extended.<br></p><p>Failure to attend a lab class means that you cannot submit the report for that lab and so loose the marks it contributes to the continuous assessment. Failure to attend the seminar (poster session) also means loss of the marks for that part of the continuous assessment (a lot of marks). If a student is sick or other wise has a special consideration and cannot attend their poster session they will typically be given the groups mark as long as a special consideration is granted by faculty. <br></p></p></pre></p>

The final poster is based on other people's work as you are turning a published paper into a conference poster so it must carry a reference to the original paper AND a statement saying this poster was prepared from the work of {paper's authors} in {reference} for use in a teaching exercise on poster presentation. <br></p></p></pre></p>

Instead the text book is recommended reading to help explain the lectures. If you do not understand the lecture reading the test book should help.<br></p><p>The recommended text book is <br></p><p>Medical Physiology by Walter F. Boron (Author), Emile L. Boulpaep (Author) now in its 3rd edition however any of the previous editions is fine. <br></p></p></pre></p>

The peer assessment is used to 1) keep the posters pitched to the class not the instructor as the class members are ranking you not just the instructor. 2) Real grants, publications and science depend on peer review not some old professor so including peer review in a simulated conference session adds the the real work place of being a scientist.</p><p>The poster is a group project but you get to chose your own group members so organize a group of 2-3 in the first few weeks and make sure you are all in the same poster session presentation time slot. The end of semester is hectic with assessments so doing as much work on the major assignment early in semester is a good idea.</p><p>The timetable with due dates and schedule is on LMS not this outline as it is too hard to make the formatting work <br></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
