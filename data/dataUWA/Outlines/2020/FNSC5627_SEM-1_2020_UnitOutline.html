Students can commence the unit in either semester 1 or semester 2. Students learn the principles and practice of forensic anthropology by conducting independent research. The output of the latter will take the form of a professional report formatted to the exact requirements of medico-legal practice for submission in a court of law (scientific report). Students are required to search for, and interpret, relevant literature and may also involve the formulation of experimental objectives that are tested based on their development of an appropriate methodology. The unit facilitates an understanding of how to analyse, interpret and present findings in the context of their engagement as a Forensic Anthropologist.</td>

                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit is taken over two successive semesters and Parts I and II must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. This unit is designed to provide students with experience in independent scientific study through the completion of a small-scale research project that has direct relevance to the professional practice of Forensic Anthropology. Students will develop scientific writing skills by compiling a manuscript on their research topic, which if deemed to be of a suitable quality, will be submitted for consideration for publication in an appropriate journal. Students will be able to select a topic of interest from one of a number of current projects that being undertaken by higher research degree students within the Centre – the primary supervision of the project will be provided by Centre academic staff in collaboration with the relevant student.</p><p>Part I of the unit requires achievement of the following milestones: attendance at supervisor meetings; selecting an appropriate research topic; project design and submission of a research proposal; applying for relevant ethical approval(s); identifying a suitable target journal for publication; and data collection. </p><p>Part II of the unit requires achievement of the following milestones: attendance at supervisor meetings; data analysis and interpretation; oral presentation; and submission of journal article.</p></p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Lecture Capture System</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>In accordance with UWA’s policy on lecture capture all lectures* in enabled venues will be recorded and made available to stream and download by enrolled students via the Lecture Capture System (LCS) for the duration of the unit (including Supplementary and Deferred Examinations period).

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit is designed to develop a higher capacity for independent learning and research, concurrent with enhanced problem-solving, critical thinking, and scientific communication skills (both written and oral). It is very important that you have effective time management skills in order to meet the strict submission deadlines for the assessments in this unit.&nbsp;</p><p>The research scope of the Master of Forensic Anthropology professional project is more limited than that required for a thesis because it represents only one quarter of the requirements for the degree. Whereas a thesis must have a research program with original data collection approved by the Graduate Research School, the professional project generally involves small-scale data collection and analysis that is approved internally by the Centre (although still subject to relevant UWA ethical approvals). The project must be analytical, but it is not essential that the candidate has collected the original data, but there must be an original analytical component.&nbsp;<br></p></p></pre></p>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>You are required in Week One to identify a supervisor(s) and arrange a regular day and time for weekly meetings that is suitable to you both. The purpose of those meetings is for you to work with your supervisor to develop a topic and research proposal (see below), seek guidance on how collect and analyse your data and obtain feedback on written of your journal article. It is your responsibility to prepare for those meetings; for example, if you wish to have feedback on written work, then it must be submitted at least 1-week prior (supervisor will confirm specific requirements). If you cannot attend your scheduled meeting then you must let your supervisor know in advance (where possible); the same courtesy is expected from your supervisor, who will be responsible for arranging an alternate meeting (if required).<br></p><p>Whilst it is preferable that students develop their own ideas for research topics, some of the current topic of interest to the Centre and/or based on active student research projects include:</p><p>•	Population-specific standards – morphometric and morphoscopic</p><p>•	Subjectivity in anthropological assessment</p><p>•	Bone histology</p><p>•	Human and non-human bone morphology</p><p>•	Virtual anthropology</p><p>•	Bioarchaeology or physical anthropology (by arrangement</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
