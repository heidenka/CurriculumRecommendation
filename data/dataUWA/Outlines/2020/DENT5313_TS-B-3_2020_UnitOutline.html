Like Growth and Development (Level I and II), this course is self-instructional, but has Lectures on specific topics related to orthodontic treatment.  You will have personal contact with faculty in seminars and the rostered clinics to discuss material you have learned from computer teaching programs and reading assignments.The self-instructional materials can be viewed at any time during the unit. The orthodontics course is in four didactic units in which the self-instructional material is concentrated and spans over the first few months. Superimposed in this time are the Clinical rosters. Level IV introduces students to more complex and Advanced Orthodontics.</p><p><strong>Paedatric Dentistry Module:</strong></p><p>This module introduces the students to the dental management of child and adolescent patients. It intends to provide the student with the theoretical, practical clinical knowledge on the normal growth and development of the dentition (primary, mixed and permanent), common dental conditions and /or anomalies that occur in a children and adolescents. Furthermore, the student’s will have the opportunity to carry out the clinical techniques commonly used in paediatric dentistry to prevent and/or manage these dental conditions in a clinical environment.</p><p><strong>See Module Guidebooks</strong></p><p>Additional Orthodontic Screening Sessions may become available for students to attend on a first come first serve basis for those that have an interest in orthodontics or may need to make-up a missed Rostered Orthodontic session.</p><p><strong>COEUS assessment</strong> will be utilized for clinical teaching. <br></p><p><strong>All UWA and OHCWA guidelines to be followed with regards to patient care and management will apply</strong></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
