If you are unable to attend, it is your responsibility to inform the supervisor and unit co-ordinator with ample</p><p>notice. Medical certificates will be required as per Faculty Policy.</p><p>Professional Behaviour</p><p>Professional Behaviour in podiatry is based on behaviour that comprises clinical competence, communications skills and ethical behaviour and</p><p>professionally respectful and responsible attitudes. Podiatry students have certain privileges and responsibilities different from those of other</p><p>students. Because of this, different standards of professional behaviour are expected of you. Podiatry students from the first day of commencing studies</p><p>are reminded of the important role of professional behaviour. This plays an important role in maintaining trust amongst patients and the community.</p><p>Professional behaviour that comes under this protocol includes:</p><p>• Behaviour in small group sessions – laboratories/ tutorials / workshops</p><p>• Behaviour in lectures and clinical laboratories – punctuality and no talking or whispering while the lecturer is speaking</p><p>• Attendance at scheduled teaching, learning sessions, internal and external clinics</p><p>• Communications on unit websites, social media and examination papers</p><p>• Communications with faculty staff</p><p>• Conduct in relation to the ethical and professional behaviour expected of a podiatric student at UWA</p><p>A professional approach to the practice of podiatry should be reflected in the appearance and conduct of the student practitioner.</p><p>During clinical sessions, students must demonstrate professional presentation and conduct by:</p><p>• Attending clinic sessions in clean, neat and presentable clinical clothes</p><p>• Ensuring punctual attendance at the clinic, i.e. 15 mins prior to the commencement of clinic.</p><p>• Being prepared for the patient, with appropriate instruments being ready prior to seating the patient</p><p>• Ensuring patient treatment is completed on time and planning of the next visit takes place if appropriate</p><p>• Maintaining rapport and treating clinic personnel with respect</p><p>Attendance is compulsory for clinical laboratories, student clinic and external placements. Attendance will be taken at these compulsory sessions. Students</p><p>must ensure they have signed in for the teaching sessions where roll is kept. It is not the responsibility of the tutor or demonstrator. You will be considered</p><p>to be absent if you have not signed in for the session.</p><p>Students can only miss 1 compulsory session during the semester without a medical certificate. In the case of illness, a medical certificate (not provided by</p><p>a family member) must be supplied to the unit coordinator within one week of return to classes. Any missed tasks will need to be completed by this time.</p><p>Note that the onus is on the student to make contact regarding absences. If a student misses more than this, he/she will be expected to contact the unit</p><p>coordinator with an explanation. A failure to provide a valid explanation, or further missed classes will result in action according to the FMDHS Professional</p><p>Behaviour Assessment.</p><p>Lateness: Students who are consistently late to teaching sessions and clinics (more than 10 minutes) will be marked as late and an explanation will be</p><p>sought from the student. Your fellow students and teachers appreciate punctuality which is part of professional behaviour and courtesy. Multiple late arrivals</p><p>will be managed according to the FHMS Professional Behaviour Assessment. Late arrival at lectures and clinical laboratories is also discourteous and</p><p>unprofessional. If you are unavoidably late, it is important that you do not enter a lecture theatre by the front entrance.</p><p>Adherence to rostered session times: It is critical that where a student is assigned to attend a particular session at a particular time, only that session may be</p><p>attended. Students are not to attend non-assigned sessions for their convenience. Students doing so will be subject to the FMDHS Professional Behaviour</p><p>Assessment process.</p><p>Patient confidentiality. As podiatry students you are of course not only free to discuss your experiences with each other, but you are actually encouraged to</p><p>do so. Some teaching may involve discussion of clinical cases. Do not discuss these where you may be overheard by the public. DO NOT upload</p><p>information or images regarding clinical cases to social media sites. It is important to remember that any information you learn about a patient should be</p><p>regarded as a matter of professional confidence.</p><p>Important in any definition of professionalism is acknowledgment of the trust that must exist between the patient and the practitioner. A podiatrist must</p><p>demonstrate respect of the podiatrist-patient relationship and the implied responsibilities thereof.</p><p>Podiatry students must demonstrate professional responsibility by:</p><p>• Providing each patient with adequate and appropriate explanations of intended procedures</p><p>• Understanding and responding appropriately to patients’ needs or concerns</p><p>• Maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of patient records</p><p>• Responding appropriately to any discomfort experienced by the patient</p><p>• Ensuring that following any procedure, the patients’ knowledge and understanding of the performed procedure is adequate.</p><p>Professional Competence: An expert level of knowledge, competence and skill in a particular area is expected of a professional person. A podiatrist must</p><p>demonstrate a professional level of competence through his/her actions.</p><p>During clinical sessions, podiatry students must demonstrate professional competence by:</p><p>• Demonstrating correct infection control procedures</p><p>• Complying with all Faculty and Unit policies, guidelines and procedural manuals</p><p>• Showing diagnostic initiative and accuracy</p><p>• Accepting constructive criticism and demonstrating the ability to critique one’s own work</p><p>• Ensuring that patient records are accurate, complete and legible</p><p>• Showing a detailed understanding of the procedures to be undertaken during the session</p><p>• Awareness of patient safety and appropriate use of posture techniques</p><p>To complement existing University Policies and Standards, the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences has developed a uniform policy on professional</p><p>behaviour for students.</p><p>At all times, students will be expected to review and adhere to the standards as set out in the following:</p><p>a. FHMS Policy on Professional Behaviour for Students: available from the Faculty Webpage</p><p><a href='http://www.meddent.uwa.edu.au/teaching/policies/professional-behaviour' target='_blank' >http://www.meddent.uwa.edu.au/teaching/policies/professional-behaviour</a></p><p>b.

                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
