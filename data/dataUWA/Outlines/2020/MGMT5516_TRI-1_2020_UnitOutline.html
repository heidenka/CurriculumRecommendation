It provides a general overview of the immense changes in the social landscape both globally and locally, which have occurred in recent years, examines social entrepreneurship, social innovation, social design, systems thinking and the role of the third sector in Australia in some depth and introduces students to many of the concepts and topics explored in greater depth in the other three courses in the Graduate Certificate including social finance, impact investing, corporate community investment, philanthropy and social impact assessment.
You will find a plethora of terms and definitions in this field and we will explore them in depth through the unit. Here are a couple of key definitions of the concepts of social enterprise and social innovation to start us off.

Social enterprises are organisations that: ‘Are led by an economic, social, cultural, or environmental mission consistent with a public or community benefit; trade to fulfil their mission; derive a substantial portion of their income from trade; and reinvest the majority of their profit/surplus in the fulfilment of their mission’ (Barraket et al. 2016; p. 3). Roger Martin and Sally Osberg from the Skoll Foundation categorise the “social entrepreneur” as someone who targets an unfortunate but stable equilibrium that causes the neglect, marginalization, or suffering of a segment of humanity; who brings to bear on this situation his or her inspiration, direct action, creativity, courage, and fortitude; and who aims for and ultimately affects the establishment of a new stable equilibrium that secures permanent benefit for the targeted group and society at large” (Martin and Osberg 2007, p39).  As in the case of social enterprise and social entrepreneurship, social innovation can be defined as “A novel solution to a social problem that is more effective, efficient, sustainable, or just than existing solutions and for which the value created accrues primarily to society as a whole rather than private individuals” Though these terms may be relatively new, they have deep roots in the history of social change and development. This course explores these concepts and others both theoretically and practically.

Unit content:
The course examines the accelerating economic relationship between government, business and the third sector and the way this delivers social (including environmental) value in communities and drives social innovation. The course first examines the social economy through the emerging spectrum of organisational forms that generate both social and economic value: from not-for-profit organisations, to social enterprises, through to socially responsible business and traditional corporations, and government. It looks at why the traditional boundaries and relationships between government, business and the third sector have become blurred and fluid and what that means for the capacity of the community to deliver new forms of social impact.  A key focus in this part of the course is on social enterprises.  
Second, the course examines trends and drivers re-shaping the dynamics of social impact. It reviews the key changes that have occurred within each of the sectors: the changing role of government from direct provider to enabler and the increasing focus of government programs on outcomes; the emergence of corporate responsibility within the business sector; the emergence of social enterprises within the third sector and the emergence of impact investing, new forms of philanthropy and social investment; and the increased emphasis by all sectors on the measurement of social impact. The course examines the ways in which these changes have been driven by innovation and, in turn drive social innovation. It incorporates a detailed analysis of Australian trends and challenges and includes assessment tasks that require a critical review of global trends and organisations that effect social change and impact. The analysis of social innovation in this course will be undertaken with particular regard to a systems thinking approach. 
Third, the course provides students with an introduction to social design and applies design concepts to complex social issues and society at large. Social design approaches have become an essential component of social planning and of finding innovative solutions to social problems.
Fourth, the course introduces the concept of systems thinking and how it can provide a framework to understand the interlocking nature of many of Australia's social issues.
In a course like this, with a broad overview, we touch on key themes delving into some in greater depth. However, the case studies discussed in class and in assignments will provide opportunities to explore the themes in more detail.


Unit goals:
The course aims to develop an awareness and critical understanding of the accelerating economic relationship between the government, business and the third sectors and the way it is driving the delivery of social (including environmental) value in communities, and the way in which this (accelerating economic) relationship drives social innovation, both globally and locally. It aims to equip you to bring a cross-sector understanding of key concepts as they apply to each of the government, business and third sectors and to use this understanding to operate effectively in this changed and changing environment.

                    <h3>Teaching and Learning Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>We believe that learning is a dynamic process involving: the instructor; the instructors’ experiences; the subject matter; and the learning styles and experience of the students. Students often hold the wisdom of the subject within themselves. Their experiences are therefore an integral ingredient in the learning experience; they need to be accessed through effective facilitation to enable students to make sense of the materials and enrich the learning experience for others.
In order to enrich the learning process with students’ experiences, we actively encourage students to contribute in group and class discussions and in-class learning activities. All class activities and discussions employ some form of Socratic dialogue to challenge students to seek solutions to both simple and complex problems from a range of perspectives. To enact this approach, we pose problems common to the topic, use guest lecturers and cases to stimulate discussion and critical analysis. We make use of case studies to generate debate and encourage critical and creative thinking in each topic to which students can relate. Thus, to get the most out of this unit, students are required to attend and participate in each lecture having undertaken the required pre-reading and be willing to listen and contribute to class discussions.</p></pre></p>

More formally, the University regulations state that ‘to complete a course or unit students shall attend prescribed classes, lectures, seminars and tutorials’. Where a student, due to exceptional circumstances, is unable to attend a scheduled class, they are required to obtain prior approval of the unit coordinator to be absent from that class. Any student absent from class without having had such absence approved by the unit coordinator may be referred to the faculty for advice and may be required to withdraw from the unit.</p></pre></p>

The Harvard style is the preferred used unless otherwise stated by the unit coordinator. There are some notes for guidance which have been prepared by the library staff: ‘Citing your Sources Harvard Style’ . The EndNote software package is a really good system for building up a database of references. Not everyone will want to invest the time in using this system but you should consider it if you intend to build up resource materials or plan to undertake extensive research in a particular area. The library staff have also developed a tutoring package: ‘A Quick Guide to Using EndNote’ which provides the basics for using EndNote with an essay <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote' target='_blank' >http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote</a></p></pre></p>

                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
