                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Students cover clinically relevant concepts in the disciplines of Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Genetics, Pharmacology, Pathology, Population Science and Behavioural Science. Students undertake introductory learning of molecules, cells and tissues, and the basics of scientific research and medical evidence. This progresses to organ system learning with a focus on the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and neurological systems and the head, neck and sensory organs. Students are also introduced to professional practice including the theory of communication skills within podiatric practice. Concurrently, students cover content related to blood and drugs (haematology and pharmacology), and body defences (microbiology and immunology).<br></p><p>The DPM course requires dedication and there is an enormous amount of knowledge and skill to acquire over the duration of the program. As you progress through the course, we expect you to develop an increasing amount of responsibility for your own learning, with the ability to identify your strengths and weaknesses and to ask for assistance from your discipline leads when required. It is unlikely that you can adequately prepare for assessment solely in the study breaks. Students who study at a steady pace throughout the semester will be best placed to perform well in assessments.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a strong emphasis on the development of the professional behaviour required of a doctor of podiatric medicine. Obvious manifestations of this include a commitment to taking full advantage of the learning opportunities provided for you in this course, avoiding absenteeism, arriving to teaching sessions punctually and behaving respectfully to your teachers and peers.&nbsp;</p><p>The academics involved in teaching this unit are required to distil the vast amount of information available into that which is specifically relevant for you at this stage of the course, while working across disciplines to integrate the content, reinforce core areas and avoid duplication. Queries related to unit structure, administration and feedback should be conducted through your class representatives.</p></p></pre></p>

Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) students have certain privileges and responsibilities different from those of other students. Because of this, different standards of professional behaviour are expected of DPM students.</p><p>Doctor of Podiatric Medicine students from the first day of commencing studies are reminded of the important role of professional behaviour. This plays an important role in maintaining trust amongst</p><p>patients and the community. Professional behaviour that comes under this protocol includes:</p><p> Behaviour in small group sessions – laboratories and eLearning sessions</p><p> Behaviour in lectures – punctuality and no talking or whispering while the lecturer is speaking</p><p> Attendance at scheduled teaching and learning sessions</p><p> Communications on unit websites, social media and examination papers</p><p> Communications with faculty staff</p><p> Conduct in relation to the ethical and professional behaviour expected of a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine student at UWA</p><p><strong>Attendance</strong> at lectures is expected and is compulsory for laboratory and eLearning sessions.Attendance will be taken at these compulsory sessions. Students must ensure they have signed in for the teaching sessions where roll is kept. It is not the responsibility of the tutor or demonstrator. Students will be considered to be absent if you have not signed in for the session. Students can only miss 1 compulsory session during the semester without a medical certificate. In the case of illness, a medical certificate (not provided by a family member) must be supplied to the unit coordinator within one week of return to classes. Any missed tasks will need to be completed by this time. Note that the onus is on the student to make contact regarding absences. If a student misses more than this, he/she will be expected to contact the unit coordinator with an explanation. A failure to provide a valid explanation, or further missed classes will result in action according to the FHMS Professional Behaviour Assessment, available on the DPM Community LMS page.</p><p><strong>Lateness:</strong> Students who are consistently late to teaching sessions (more than 10 minutes) will be marked as late and an explanation will be sought from the student. Your fellow students and teachers appreciate punctuality which is part of professional behaviour and courtesy. Multiple late arrivals will be managed according to the FHMS Professional Behaviour Assessment. Late arrival at lectures is also discourteous and unprofessional. If you are unavoidably late, it is important that you do not enter a lecture theatre by the front entrance.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Adherence to rostered session times:</strong> It is critical that where a student is assigned to attend a particular session at a particular time, only that session may be attended. Students are not to attend non-assigned sessions for their convenience. Students doing so will be subject to the FHMS Professional Behaviour Assessment process.</p><p><br></p><p>To complement existing University Policies and Standards, the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences (FHMS) have developed a uniform policy on professional behaviour for students. At all times, students will be expected to review and adhere to the standards as set out in the following:</p><p> FHMS Professional Behaviour Assessment on the DPM Community LMS site</p><p> FHMS Policy on Professional Behaviour for Students: available from the Faculty Webpage: <a href='http://www.meddent.uwa.edu.au/teaching/policies/professional-behaviour' target='_blank' >http://www.meddent.uwa.edu.au/teaching/policies/professional-behaviour</a></p><p> UWA’s Regulations for Student Conduct and Discipline: <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/regulations/student-conduct' target='_blank' >http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/regulations/student-conduct</a></p><p> UWA’s Guidelines on Ethical Scholarship, Academic Literacy and Academic Misconduct: www.teachingandlearning.uwa.edu.au/page/59146</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
