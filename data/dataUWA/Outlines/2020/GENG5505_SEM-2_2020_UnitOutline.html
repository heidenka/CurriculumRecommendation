                                    <td>This unit introduces students to relevant aspects of project management and engineering practice that they need to successfully transition from formal education to professional practice. As the industry becomes increasingly 'project focused', employers are seeking engineers who possess strong project management knowledge, skills and capabilities in line with sustainable principles and ethical standards, to be applied to 'real world projects'. The unit focuses on real world engineering projects and benefits the students significantly by enhancing their capabilities and employability skills. In the unit, students learn to (1) research and analyse a real world engineering project to which key concepts and theories of sustainable and ethical project management are applied—implement a rigorous approach to analysing the project by applying a globally recognised project life cycle framework; (2) identify and analyse the problems encountered in each stage of the project and establish relevant inferences; (3) provide prioritised recommendations based on the benefits and consequences deriving from them; and (4) analyse project stakeholders' input and influence and manage them accordingly. Students enhance their interpersonal skills as they are required to take an active part in group meetings, share group coordination and leadership and learn how to negotiate and solve conflict. Students also liaise with key industry representatives, giving them the opportunity to establish professional relationships.</td>

A TBL approach to project management is now widely recognised by many organizations as being vital to achieving their strategic objectives. The achievement of strategic objectives often involves innovation and change. When innovation and change are associated with sustainable project management, organizations not only obtain a long-term competitive advantage, but they achieve it with strong support from a wide range of stakeholders. These are vital ingredients for organizations to remain viable and thrive over the long term. </p><p>On completion of this unit, students should be able to:</p><p>1. Evaluate sustainable project management theories and frameworks and apply them to ‘real world projects’;</p><p>2. Identify and evaluate problems relating to initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling projects and choose appropriate frameworks and theories to solve them;</p><p>3. Understand how to align projects with organizational goals, and recognize the strategic significance of successful project portfolio selection;</p><p>4. Identify key project stakeholders and propose effective response strategies to manage stakeholder pressure in both local and global projects;</p><p>5. Formulate effective communication strategies (both written and oral) to correspond successfully with a wide range of project stakeholders;</p><p>6. Understand, apply and evaluate how to manage and lead a team throughout the various phases of a project, and propose strategies to actively solve conflict among team members;</p><p>7. Evaluate the main normative ethical theories and apply them to specific ‘real world projects’.</p></p></pre></p>

The first part on project management applied to engineering practice will run for eight weeks. The second part on ethics applied to project management and engineering practice will run from week nine to week twelve. It involves weekly pre-recorded on line lectures (two per week) and on line practical classes (one per week). The lectures provide a summary of core concepts and theories of sustainable project management and their application to engineering practice. They will summarize key concepts and theories found in the text, but will also add further information not included in the text. This means that the text is important in providing examples and discussion on the core concepts and theories, but it is not a substitute for the lectures and the additional readings. These concepts and theories will then be applied to project management and engineering practice settings through group and on line class discussions of the assigned weekly case studies during the practical classes.</p></pre></p>

The group project will be regularly discussed during the on line practical classes. Additionally students are required to present their chosen project by the end of week 7. Further details will be provided as soon as the classes commence.</p><p>The second part of the course, which will run for four weeks is comprised of eight lectures (two per week) and four practical classes (one per week). The lectures will, firstly, introduce students to the main normative ethical theories (and frameworks) and how they apply to a variety of project management and engineering practice scenarios. Secondly, the lectures will focus on ethical issues specific to professional life, including a discussion of the benefits and limitations of professional codes of ethics, and other important aspects of professional ethics. Relevant ethical dilemmas will then be discussed in depth and applied to real world professional scenarios in the weekly practical classes.</p><p>The final exam will test students’ understanding of project management concepts and theories applied to engineering practice, with a major focus on ethical and sustainable implementation. Further details will be provided all through the course.</p></p></pre></p>

All assignments that you submit MUST acknowledge all the different sources you have used. Not to acknowledge your sources is plagiarism. Neither the School nor the University accepts ignorance or the fact that a student’s previous acts of plagiarism had been undetected as a defence. Serious cases of plagiarism shall be referred to the University’s Board of Discipline. All students should note that cases of copying are reported to the School and documentary evidence, along with associated correspondence is placed on the student’s permanent record. In order to avoid engaging in plagiarism it is YOUR responsibility to acknowledge all of your sources in any work submitted for assessment and it is essential that you reference the work of others correctly. Where you quote directly from a source, you must ensure that any direct quotations are placed in quotation marks and are fully referenced. Even when you do not quote directly and are just referring to or expanding on the work of others, you must still acknowledge the sources of your information and ideas. Each time that text is copied, the source must be acknowledged with a reference citation, including the page number. The Harvard style is the preferred referencing style, and for guidance on how to use it correctly please read the information available online: <a href='http://guides.is.uwa.edu.au/harvard' target='_blank' >http://guides.is.uwa.edu.au/harvard</a></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
                    <p>If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:</p>
