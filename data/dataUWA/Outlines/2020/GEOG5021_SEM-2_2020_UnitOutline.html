                    <h4>Unit Details</h4>
                    <p>GEOG5021 - Honours Research Project in Geography, Environment and Planning Part 1 - SEM-2-2020 - 2020 - Face to face / Blended learning</p>
                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>The Research Project is an independent supervised research activity offered within the Department of Geography and Planning. For many students, this is the first taste of the excitement of doing their own research, where the outcomes of the work are not known with certainty and where new knowledge is created. By undertaking the Research Project, you will, in consultation with your supervisors, define your project and develop research questions or hypotheses, set objectives and aims, plan and execute the research, interpret the results and present those results in oral and written forms. The final output of your research project will be a Research Thesis similar in content and context to a peer-reviewed research article in an academic journal.</p><p>The focus of the Research Project is to provide you with the opportunity to start developing the tools necessary to undertake independent research. With this goal in mind, the assessment of your progress is focused on the process of doing research and your ability to assess, interpret and integrate the results that you produce. While the focus is not on the quantity of results that you generate, assessors will have a minimum expectation as appropriate for your project. It is highly probable that a student with an adequate set of high-quality results that are well presented, interpreted and integrated will score better than a student who produces an outstanding set of results that are poorly interpreted, synthesised and/or compiled into the final Research Thesis. </p><p>Your work will be assessed by staff from a panel of assessors selected by administrative academic staff within the School. As the assessors might not be directly in your discipline, it is very important that you write and present your work in such a way that a knowledgeable person can read and understand it, even if it is outside of their specific sub-discipline.</p><p>By the time you submit your Research Thesis, you will have further developed your skills in finding and evaluating relevant literature; identifying gaps in knowledge, critical thinking and analysis; working on your own initiative; designing appropriate forms of data analysis; responding to comments and criticism and presenting your results in written and oral forms. Importantly, you will also be able to use and strengthen your time management skills. Most employers expect to see evidence of these skills, hence your Research Thesis is vitally important for you to be able to provide evidence of these skills to potential employers.</p><p>The data collected in your Research Thesis can form the basis of future research at postgraduate level and give you essential experience of a research career. You can also develop highly useful links with other researchers and industry contacts which can help you move into a career path of your choice. Most students view the Research Project as the pinnacle of their university experience and the role of your supervisors is to guide you to gaining as much as possible from this process.</p></p></pre></p>

Students should view the four-unit parts as one fully integrated 24-point activity. Full time students enrol in Parts 1 and 2 of the Research Project in one semester and Parts 3 and 4 in the next semester, whereas part time Masters Students may complete the research project across more than two semesters.</p><p>All students should make appointments with staff in the Student Office to confirm their study plan for all units prior to the commencement of the semester.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
