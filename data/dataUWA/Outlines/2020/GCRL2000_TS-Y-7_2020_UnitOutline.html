The style is akin to that of a Three Minute Thesis (3MT) and designed to improve your academic, presentation, and research communication skills. The presentation will be followed by 2 – 3 minutes of questions. All students will receive feedback on their presentation.</p><p>Due Date: during the Summer Residence 9th-12th February, 2020. Exact date, time and location will be confirmed at least 2 weeks prior to the Residence at which time the title of the presentation must be provided.</p><p>Requirements:</p><p>* Submit the presentation title to Phoebe Spencer at phoebe.spencer@uwa.edu.au at least 2 weeks prior to the Summer Residence.</p><p>* Prepare one PowerPoint slide to complement the presentation. Animation may be used.</p><p>* Bring the PowerPoint on a USB and load onto the presentation desktop at least 10 minutes prior to the start of the timeslot.</p><p>In preparing your presentation consider the following:</p><p>* Write for your audience – avoid jargon, explain important concepts, highlight the significance/relevance of the research topic/problem.</p><p>* Tell a story – consider using an opener to catch the audiences’ attention, then highlight the different points and have a summary to restate the importance. Try to leave the audience with an understanding of what the problem is, what you (or your group) are doing and why it is important.</p><p>Examples of Three Minute Thesis presentations can be found at: <a href='http://www.postgraduate.uwa.edu.au/students/resources/3mt/uwa-three-minute-thesis' target='_blank' >http://www.postgraduate.uwa.edu.au/students/resources/3mt/uwa-three-minute-thesis</a></p><p><strong>Research Portfolio</strong></p><p>A research portfolio is a collection and critical reflection on the activities undertaken during the research placement. It is used to demonstrate your learning and skills development. It should not be thought of simply as an assessment task. A well-developed and maintained portfolio will provide a useful tool to draw upon and provide evidence of your skills and experiences when applying for scholarships, internships and jobs. For those students moving into professional degrees such as the Masters of Professional Engineering and the MD program that include development of professional portfolios as part of the course, this will provide useful practice in documenting and reflecting on your experiences.</p><p>Start creating a draft Portfolio as soon as you start your placement. Use it to store your notes, documents, readings, images and reflections. For more information on creating your Portfolio see the Assessment Tab in the unit LMS.</p><p>Due Date: 16th February, 2020 by 11:59 pm. Submit via LMS &gt; Assessment &gt; Research Portfolio.</p><p>Requirements: Your Portfolio should be between 1000-1500 words and include:</p><p>* Research Overview: a brief overview of the research topic / area that you are involved in. That is, describe the background to the research, the overall aims and any specific aims of the component you are involved in, the importance/significance of the work – what does it contribute to theory or practice in the field?</p><p>* Research activities: a summary of the activities that you engaged in with a particular focus on those agreed to in your Agreement Form. For each activity provide a description of what you did, provide some evidence or examples (e.g. links to reports, papers or abstracts that you have read or written; date and brief summary of seminars / discussions / meetings attended; photo of experiment set-up where appropriate).</p><p>*A reflection on your involvement. That is, what did you learn from the experience; how could what you have learned be applied or be useful to later study and/or career? Did you face any difficulties with the research placement (expected or unexpected)? Did things go to plan? Why / why not?</p><p class=""><strong>Research Mentor’s Report</strong></p><p>Please download the report form from the LMS and provide to your mentor (the form is also available at the end of this document). Mentors are asked to evaluate your participation and achievement in the research placement in relation to the learning outcomes. Mentors are encouraged to discuss their report with you prior to submission directly to the BPhil Office via email (bphilhons-studserv@uwa.edu.au). It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that the report form is submitted to the BPhil Office by the stipulated deadline.</p><p>Due Date: 16th February, 2019</p><p>Responsibilities of Students</p><p>Time commitment - 75 hours active participation</p><p>* It is very important to discuss and negotiate your time availability with your research mentor very early in the process and prior to the submission of the Agreement Form. You need to be able to dedicate sufficient time each week to your placement.</p><p>* Some placements may have particular time requirements, for example, the running of an experiment may take 3 or 4 hours and might also need set-up and set-down time. If you do not have a clear day in your timetable, this type of activity may not be suitable. Attendance at School seminars may occur on a set day and time each week; if this is an agreed activity you need to ensure that you are available to attend.</p><p><strong>Absences</strong></p><p>* Notify your mentor (and other staff and students involved in your placement) if you are going to be absent. Absences should be for valid reasons only such as illness and exceptional and unavoidable circumstances. If you know you will have a heavy assignment load at a particular time of semester, factor that in when negotiating your placement. Please respect the resources and effort that have gone into providing you with a research placement.</p><p>Withdrawal from placement</p><p>* If you are unable to dedicate sufficient time or if a placement is affected by unforeseen circumstances beyond your control you are advised to defer your placement until a later semester.</p><p>* Last day to withdraw without academic penalty. Please refer to: <a href='http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/course/dates' target='_blank' >http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/course/dates</a></p><p>* Students who withdraw after the last date for withdrawal without academic penalty will receive an Ungraded Fail, unless Special Consideration or other mitigating circumstances apply (e.g. unforeseen mentor absence, equipment breakdown, delay in ethics approval). Prioritising other academic or regular extra-curricular commitments over the Research Placement is not grounds for Special Consideration.</p><strong>Conflict</strong><p>* If you are in conflict with your mentor or other member of the research group, you must discuss the matter immediately with Dr Kathy Sanders, Dr Chris Lin or Dr Phoebe Spencer. We try to ensure that conflicts do not arise, but if they do there is more than one avenue open to you to seek advice and support.</p><p><strong>Charter of Student Rights and Responsibilities</strong></p><p>This Charter of Student Rights and Responsibilities upholds the fundamental rights of students who undertake their education at the University of Western Australia.</p><p>It recognises that excellence in teaching and learning requires students to be active participants in their educational experience.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>

UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
