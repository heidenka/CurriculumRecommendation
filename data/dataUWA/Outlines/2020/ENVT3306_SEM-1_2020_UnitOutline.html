Through a combination of lectures, practical work and local field visits, students are introduced to conservation and management activities at the domestic and international level taken in response to contemporary human impacts on our coasts. Central themes include measures designed to reduce coastal water and sediment contamination from both point and non-point sources, policies to facilitate the conservation of marine flora and fauna and practices designed to mitigate the physical impacts of sea level rise in an inherently dynamic environment. The success or otherwise of these measures are assessed from a variety of environmental, social and economic perspectives in order to facilitate students' critical understanding of conservation and management in coastal regions. Through studying the unit, students gain a holistic appreciation of the unique threats facing coastal ecosystems and our ability to address these successfully.</td>

                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit provides a detailed overview and analysis of actions, initiatives and priorities necessary for the long term conservation and management of coastal ecosystems in a context of increasing threat and uncertainty. It should be of interest to anyone concerned with how we can conserve and sustain the ecological and environmental assets and values associated with our coast.</p><p>Coastal conservation and management has evolved from coastal engineering, whereby policies were designed to reduce threats to property and infrastructure, to the present day focus on minimizing resource conflict through policies which address values held by multiple stakeholders and reflect the dynamic, unpredictable and varied nature of coastal environments.</p><p>The unit includes lectures, tutorials and a field trip aimed at providing students with the skills necessary to successfuly diagnose problems in coastal environments, and suggest appropriate management actions.</p></p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Lecture Capture System</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>In accordance with UWA’s policy on lecture capture all lectures* in enabled venues will be recorded and made available to stream and download by enrolled students via the Lecture Capture System (LCS) for the duration of the unit (including Supplementary and Deferred Examinations period).

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit will commence with an examination of how such a management approach reflects contemporary debates over environmental vulnerability and resilience in the context of climate change on the coast. It will then move on to examining the nature of human threats in the context of common coastal habitats in the temperate and tropical regions, illustrating the significance and impacts of these through case studies and tutorial discussions. The unit will then analyse responses to these threats within each coastal ecosystem, considering how managers seek to enhance resilience and minimize vulnerability through a range of policies and measures. The design and management of marine protected areas will form a specific area of focus with reference to tropical environments.</p><p>The unit will conclude with a discussion of issues affecting our ability to manage coastal ecosystems in a future dominated by the impacts of climate change. Tutorials will be used to explore this content in more depth through in-depth reading and discussion of key issues and guest presentations.</p><p>A field trip will also allow us to understand management issues associated with the Swan Estuary.</p><p>We very much hope that this unit provides students with the information and opportunity to become involved in the future conservation and sustainable management of our coastal resources.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 30 out of 50 (a mark of 5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
