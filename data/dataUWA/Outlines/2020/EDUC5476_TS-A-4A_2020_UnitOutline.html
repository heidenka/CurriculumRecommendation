The curriculum documents in economics, geography, history, and politics and law are used as a basis for programming and lesson planning, focusing on the development of appropriate learning strategies, selection of resources and the development of assessment programs. A range of cross-curricular topics related to supporting effective literacy and numeracy development, differentiation and inclusive schooling and the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to support student learning are also explored.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, this unit builds on student understanding of curriculum, pedagogy, planning, learning strategies, resources, assessment techniques and classroom processes gained during first semester. The main focus this semester is on the Year 11 and 12 units, in your particular discipline, while consolidating and extending the skills you developed in semester one. The teaching and learning strategies in this unit are designed to develop the skills and competencies required for teaching in the following Year 11 and 12 Units of Study: Economics, Geography, Ancient and Modern History, and Politics and Law. It is assumed that you have a strong background in your degree in at least one of these humanities and social science disciplines. The unit aims to develop resourceful teachers who are sufficiently flexible and creative to implement effective teaching and learning programs based on Year 11 and 12 Units of Study. The unit will encourage you to reassess your philosophy of teaching based on your first school experience, make a constructive evaluation of your teaching effectiveness and set realistic goals for the future.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
