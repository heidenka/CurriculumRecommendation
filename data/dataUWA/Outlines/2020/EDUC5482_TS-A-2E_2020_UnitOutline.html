Under the guidance of the mentor teacher and the University supervisor, they are encouraged to engage in reflective practice to develop their teaching styles and their confidence in management techniques. The University supervisor visits the student twice during the professional practice to provide constructive feedback and to assess the  student's level of competence. While students have the support of a mentor teacher, a high level of commitment, independence and competence is expected of students at this stage of their pre-service education.

The criteria for assessment are set out on the report forms. These reports are available online via a link which will be sent to the mentor by email.  The STAGE 2 Performance Descriptors (on pages 42-44 of the <i>Professional Practice Handbook) </i>can be used to assist in assessing a pre-service teacher’s performance during this professional practice.</p><p>Initial Report – An initial report needs to be completed online at the end of the second week of prac. This report will provide us with some preliminary feedback about the pre-service teacher’s progress and their suitability for classroom practice. </p><p>Weekly Feedback Forms – Continuous and constructive assessment is vital to the development of the pre-service teacher. Mentor teachers are asked to provide a written feedback to the pre-service teacher at the end of each week, commencing at the end of week 2. This feedback should form the basis of a discussion of the pre-service teacher's progress, identifying strengths and weaknesses and a focus for the following week and should be retained by the pre-service teacher as it will assist in the process of their critical reflection. It is not necessary to send it to the GSE.</p><p>Each pre-service teacher will be observed twice by a university supervisor. The role of the university supervisor is to work with the mentor to provide support and professional guidance in addition to assessing progress made during the professional placement. Pre-service teachers will also be required to complete a self-assessment prior to the first visit by their university supervisor. </p><p>Final Report – In preparing final reports on the second professional practice, teachers should keep in mind that pre-service teachers have had just 12 weeks of supervised professional practice and should be considered as beginning teachers. While the final report should be discussed with the pre-service teacher it should not be given to them. The final report will be completed online via a link in an email to the mentor.</p><p>The reports from mentor teachers in the school and those of University supervisors form a record of each pre-service teacher’s achievement during teaching practice and will be used to determine their grade. These reports are stored on SONIA Online where they may be freely viewed by individual pre-service teachers during the year; they are also archived for the purpose of providing references in later years should this be required. Table IV (pages 45-46 <i>Professional Practice Handbook</i>) provides an overview of the feedback and reporting requirements.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
