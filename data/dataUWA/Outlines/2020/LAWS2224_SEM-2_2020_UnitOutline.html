                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>In <i>The Age of Rights</i>, Loius Henkin observes that 'Ours is the age of rights. Human rights is the idea of our time, the only political-moral idea that has received universal acceptance.' In recent years, this assertion has come under pressure from the rise of populism. At the same time, there have recently been resurgent calls for racial and social justice. Nevertheless, there is much about human rights that is poorly understood. For example, what is the basis of rights? On what grounds are people regarded as possessing rights? A further question concerns the scope of rights. Which goods should be treated as rights and which as issues of social justice or good governance? Even if we are able to agree on these questions, how do we determine what rights require in concrete situations? Are rights invariably subject to disagreement or is their content relatively clear in most cases? Finally, how should rights be safeguarded? Does effective protection of human rights require Bills of Rights in national legal systems or is it sufficient to rely upon the democratic process and international human rights law? And if a Bill of Rights is required, what form should it take and how should it be enforced?</p><p>This unit explores these questions against the background of the Australian legal system, which is unique amongst liberal democracies in lacking a national Bill of Rights. The first part of the unit introduces the idea of human rights. It outlines the development of international and regional systems of rights protection, and Australia's participation in these systems. It also covers debates about the grounds, nature and scope of rights. Consideration is given to the statutory protections for human rights that exist in Australia at Commonwealth, State and Territory level, and the limited rights protections that exist in the Commonwealth Constitution. A relevant historical question is why rights protections are largely absent from the Commonwealth Constitution.</p><p>The second part of the unit explores contemporary human rights debates in Australia, such as asylum policy, constitutional recognition of indigenous persons, euthanasia and physician assisted suicide, and freedom of expression and hate speech. Threaded throughout these topics will be the human rights challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Students will consider the extent to which these are human rights issues and whether human rights are compromised or upheld by government policy. A key theme in this part of the unit is the adequacy of existing rights protections in domestic and international law.</p><p>The third part of the unit considers whether Australia would benefit from enhanced human rights protections in the form of a national Bill of Rights, or further human rights legislation at State and Territory level. Whether Bills of Rights are beneficial features of national legal systems, and the form that they should take, are questions of global debate and the subject of an extensive literature. Students will be introduced to the different models of rights protection that exist in jurisdictions such as the United States, Germany, South Africa, Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand; consider which model - if any - would be most appropriate for Australia; and also explore the constitutional obstacles that exist in Australia to adoption of a Bill of Rights.</p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>

The lectures will focus on introducing students to key human rights concepts and controversies. Students will then be expected to complete readings and prepare answers to questions for discussion in tutorials.</p><p>Assessment in the unit consists of a tutorial participation mark, a research essay, and a final exam. The tutorial participation mark will relate to material covered throughout the unit. The research essay will relate to the material covered in weeks 1-4. It will therefore cover an introductory topic such as international human rights treaties; international and regional systems for protection of rights; universalism and cultural relativism; or socio-economic rights. Further guidance about the topics covered in the final exam will be provided in due course.</p></p></pre></p>

The first four weeks introduces students to international and regional human rights systems and debates about the universality and scope of rights. The next five weeks covers protections for human rights in the Australian legal system and current human rights debates. The final two weeks considers global debates about Bills of Rights and the Australian Bill of Rights debate.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
