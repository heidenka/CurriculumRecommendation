A placement can involve a specific project where the student works on the solution to a problem or explores possibilities for an organisation in the for-profit, not-for-profit or public sectors. The placement may be in the nature of a paid or unpaid internship where students gain relevant work experience in a workplace environment.

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Apart from acquiring mastery over the discipline knowledge taught in your undergraduate degree, WILG2201 Professional Experience Practicum (hereafter WILG2201) provides you with an opportunity to undertake a work integrated learning experience that complements your academic studies and helps you to prepare for your chosen career upon graduation.</p><p>Undertaking WILG2201 provides many benefits. Firstly, it gives you an opportunity to put theory into practice and develop an awareness of workplace culture and expectations. Secondly, you will further enhance your ‘transferable’ skills such as communication, team work, email and report-writing skills, punctuality and attendance. Thirdly, a practicum is your opportunity to develop a practical appreciation of your chosen career and enhance your future employment prospects. Finally, your practicum is an opportunity for an employer to evaluate your potential as a future employee. Research shows that students who undertake a practicum are significantly more likely to be offered vacation work or employment on graduation.</p><p>WILG2201 can be taken in your academic program as either a Category B Broadening or elective unit.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>WILG2201 is unlike any other unit that you have taken in your degree to date as it provides you with an opportunity to undertake a minimum of 100 hours of paid and/or unpaid employment in an actual work environment under the guidance of an external supervisor within your host organisation along with the support of an academic advisor from the Faculty of Arts, Business, Law and Education (ABLE). Thus, by its very nature, WILG2201will provide you with a learning experience that is uniquely yours and different from the experiences of other students in your degree program.</p><p>In terms of having achieved the learning outcomes for WILG2201, you will be able to:</p><p>(1) apply communication and interpersonal skills to a working situation;</p><p>(2) demonstrate initiative and, where required by the host supervisor, the ability to work independently;</p><p>(3) negotiate and plan a proposal and prepare a final report;</p><p>(4) perform tasks set by an employer to a satisfactory standard; and</p><p>(5) reflect and report on your experience in the workplace.</p><p>As indicated by the above, WILG2201 places primary responsibility upon you for the achievement of these learning outcomes. Whilst the host organisation, host supervisor and your academic advisor from ABLE will contribute to the quality of your work integrated learning experience, your commitment to the practicum placement (or internship) is of the greatest significance in achieving those outcomes.</p><p>WILG2201: How is it arranged and undertaken?</p><p>Candice Brooking is the Practicum Placement Officer for ABLE and she will manage you through the process for obtaining a work integrated learning placement. Given differing degree requirements; the number of units (points) you have completed prior to seeking to enrol in WILG2201, the elective and broadening units already completed and your academic status, it is important that ensure that you have met all requirements before enrolling in WILG2201.</p><p>As the process for securing a placement is, in itself, part of the learning experience that will help prepare you for your professional career, securing a placement requires self-initiative and your active engagement. The exact nature of the placement should be articulated as closely as possible to your personal and professional interests and career aspirations.</p><p>Practicum placement opportunities that match your personal and professional interests and career aspirations can be identified from:</p><p>Advertised placements</p><p>A number of placement projects or internships may be advertised by UWA (e.g., through CareerHub or selectively targeted emails) and interested students are encouraged to apply. Depending on the number of applications, it may be necessary to shortlist students. In such a case, a selection process will be undertaken and successful candidates will be invited to enrol in WILG2201 for the purposes of undertaking their practicum placement with that host organisation.</p><p>Self-sourced (i.e., self-arranged) placement</p><p>Students are also able to nominate their own project or internship. The Practicum Coordinator will assess each self-sourced placement proposal and decide if it is suitable. Students should contact the Practicum Coordinator as early as possible to discuss their ideas for a potential self-arranged placement. Significant preparatory work must be undertaken before a self-arranged placement can be approved and students must allow sufficient time to ensure that all stages of the approval process are completed in time for the practicum to be completed during the teaching period it is to be undertaken.</p><p>Students intending to arrange their own placement should be mindful of the following guidelines:</p><p>• placements must involve work that requires a sufficiently high skill level to be appropriate to the student’s level of study;</p><p>• placements must involve at least 100 hours of work;</p><p>• placements can be for paid and or unpaid work;</p><p>• placements should not be in the form of standard casual/part-time/full-time employment and</p><p>• placement projects and work experience activities should contribute to the solution of a problem identified by the organisation or involve investigating alternatives or possible courses of action for the host organisation.</p><p>Internships</p><p>Internships are offered by organisations in the for-profit, not-for-profit and public sectors. As internships typically have no specific project upon which the practicum is undertaken, they provide students with an opportunity of experiencing what employment with the host organisation might be like upon graduation. Thus, for both the host organisation and practicum student, multiple employment outcomes emerge: ranging from demonstrating to the host how valuable a contribution has been made by the student and, for the practicum student, how well the work experience matches their academic, personal and professional expectations and aspirations. In assessing whether or not an internship is suitable for you, consider if the internship allows you to:</p><p>• critically evaluate and apply discipline-specific knowledge in a professional work environment;</p><p>• apply your communication and interpersonal skills to a professional working situation;</p><p>• negotiate, plan and prepare a proposal and make a final report on the internship that is related to your chosen major(s);</p><p>• critically reflect and report on your experience in the workplace;</p><p>• appreciate the skills you need for a successful transition to the workplace and</p><p>• identify the strengths and weaknesses in your preparation for graduate employment.</p><p>Thus, based on your own research and the practicum opportunities identified, complete the Expression of Interest (EOI) on CareerHub and upload a curriculum vitae and a covering letter that identifies yourself and your motivations is enrolling in WILG2201. The EOI can be accessed from CareerHub through: FABLE Practicum Expression of Interest.</p><p>Please note that you cannot enrol in WILG2201 until you have been advised to do so by Candice Brooking.</p><p>Whilst ABLE’s Practicum Placements Officer will assist you in identifying placement opportunities, your own initiative may be highly instrumental in you being able to secure an appropriate and professional and personally rewarding placement. Once enrolled, you are required to make an appointment to meet with Peter Robinson, the Academic Coordinator - WIL for ABLE. </p><p>Placements must be approved prior to commencement by the Practicum Placements Officer in consultation with the Academic Coordinator for ABLE practicums, otherwise you cannot be granted credit for WILG2201 even though you have undertaken a placement.</p><p>Plan: Developing your Placement</p><p>Once you have secured provisional approval for your placement, you will need to address the planning phase of your professional practicum placement. For example, there are a number of administrative matters to address that may have a significant impact upon your ability to embark on your practicum.</p><p>If you are undertaking a placement that requires you to travel, either domestically or internationally, you will need to make plans for travel and accommodation. Once you have planned your travel and accommodation arrangements, you will need to inform the University of your travel dates and accommodation arrangements along with emergency contact numbers.</p><p>You must have insurance while you complete your placement in order to protect you, your host and the University in the event of accidents and other insurable risks. Where you are not covered by your host’s workers compensation and personal liability insurance, as would be the case if you are engaged in paid employment, you will need to have a Certificate of Insurance issued by the University. Note that where your insurance is arranged by the University, a separate Certificate of Insurance must be issued for each of your placements if you are undertaking more than one placement.</p><p>Completion of the University’s Travel and Insurance form will facilitate many of these tasks and can be downloaded from LMS (see UWA_Travel_Approval_Form_Template_2018).</p><p>Student placement insurance cover policy outlines the protection available to UWA students while on course-required or relevant work experience and placements. UWA’s Insurance indemnifies the provider of work experience for liability arising out of any negligent act, error or omission on the part of a practicum student. However, this indemnity does not extend to any liability, cost or expense arising out of any negligent act or omission of the provider or any of its employees, contractors, agents, invitees or trespassers.</p><p>A portfolio of insurance policies covers a student while on work placement in an approved Practicum Placement: these policies are the group personal accident plan; public liability; medical malpractice (where appropriate) and corporate travel (when placement occurs interstate or overseas). Furthermore, you should consider if you need to include additional insurance to cover your travel and accommodation costs before, during or subsequent to your approved Practicum Placement. For a Certificate of Insurance to be issued, an email request to uwainsurance@ajg.com from the Practicum Placement Officer, Academic Coordinator or relevant head of school or dean must be submitted for this to occur. Such an email must include a statement of support or be included as an attached letter. When you go on placement, you must ensure that you take a copy of your Certificate(s) of Insurance with you and have your emergency contact numbers with you at all times.</p><p>As you may be eligible for a travel grant sourced from the University or an external funding body, you should ensure that you allow sufficient time for lodging an application for such financial support, in having it assessed and potentially approved.</p><p>Finally, planning for your practicum placement is a key step in achieving the best possible work integrated learning experience. Think about the roles and responsibilities you will undertake through your placement and reflect on how you expect this work integrated learning experience contributes to your learning and future career aspirations. If you secure a placement through an externally sourced practicum, you may have less opportunity for developing your own roles and responsibilities. Nevertheless, it is still important for you to have a clear understanding of your own roles and responsibilities and to reflect on their relationship to your academic, professional and personal aspirations.</p><p>Complete: All required Practicum Pre-Placement activities</p><p>To be permitted to undertake a Professional Practicum Placement, you may be required to engage in one or more pre-placement activities.</p><p>The Pre-placement Program</p><p>To ensure that you are ready to commence your practicum, you may be required to complete all or part of the online Pre-placement Program (PPP). The three modules that comprise the PPP will help you make the most of your Work Integrated Learning (WIL) placement by providing you with information and guidance for ensuring that, whilst you are on placement, you are safe and are able to perform your role in a professional manner, including in being able to respond appropriately to positive and negative feedback</p><p>Depending on the specific pre-placement activities that have been determined by the Practicum Coordinator, you may need to complete one or more of the following:</p><p>Occupational Health and Safety</p><p>Everyone has a right to stay safe and healthy in the workplace. In the Workplace Health and Safety module you will learn how to maintain your health, safety and well-being whilst on placement; to prevent harm to yourself and others in the workplace. Where required, you will need to self-enrol into the learning content for the Occupational Health and Safety module in ‘My Organisations’. You can self-enrol by logging into LMS, complete an ‘Organisation’ search for the ‘UWA Pre-Placement Program’ and self-enrol. The Occupational Health and Safety module includes short assessment tasks. You will need to complete these assessment tasks and achieve full marks to be eligible to undertake a work placement for credit.</p><p>Professionalism</p><p>During your placement you will be expected to adhere to various standards of behaviour and conduct. The Professionalism module will help you understand how to present a positive personal brand and make the most of your experience. Where required, you will need to self-enrol into the learning content for the Professionalism module in ‘My Organisations’. You can self-enrol by logging into LMS, complete an ‘Organisation’ search for the ‘UWA Pre-Placement Program’ and self-enrol.</p><p>The Professionalism module includes short assessment tasks. You will need to complete these assessment tasks and achieve full marks to be eligible to undertake a work placement for credit.</p><p>Feedback and Performance</p><p>Feedback is an essential part of your professional development. On your placement you may receive both positive and negative feedback. The Feedback and Performance Module will help you understand how to handle feedback in the workplace and use it to grow as an individual. Where required, you will need to self-enrol into the learning content for the Feedback and Performance module in ‘My Organisations’. You can self-enrol by logging into LMS, complete an ‘Organisation’ search for the ‘UWA Pre-Placement Program’ and self-enrol.</p><p>The Feedback and Performance module includes short assessment tasks. You will need to complete these assessment tasks and achieve full marks to be eligible to undertake a work placement for credit.</p><p>Career development workshops</p><p>To ensure that you realise the career-related outcomes of your practicum, you may be required to complete one or two career-related workshops offered by UWA Careers or other approved providers. For example, you may need to register for one or more Career workshops such as: Resume and Cover Letters, Addressing Selection Criteria, Carrer Bootcamp and Linked-in; Careers Fair events; Employer Presentations and Industry Up-date events.</p><p>Execute: Undertake your Practicum Placement</p><p>As you commence your placement with your practicum host, it is important to remember some fundamental guidelines about what a placement is, and what it is not:</p><p>• A placement is not simply ‘free labour’ for your host organisation; it must provide a genuine learning experience for you and an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills you obtained from your studies and to further develop those skills.</p><p>• In commencing your placement, you should have a clear written or verbal description of the activities that are to be undertaken during the placement. The Academic Coordinator will be available to provide advice if necessary.</p><p>• Once you have your placement roles and responsibilities established, you can start work.</p><p>On-placement activities</p><p>During your placement, please note the following:</p><p>• As stated above, your professional practicum placement is not just ‘work experience’, it is an opportunity for you to critically reflect on your learning and how it intersects with the ‘real’ world. To ensure that you maintain adequate documentary evidence to draw upon when drafting your Practicum Report, it is highly recommended that you maintain a daily or weekly diary in which you record those things that have interested, surprised and/or frustrated you. Using the STAR Analysis tool will help you make sense of some of your experiences and contribute to your ability to provide evidence of relevant workplace skills that you have developed.</p><p>• It is important to act with a high level of professionalism and integrity throughout your placement. Remember that when you are on placement, you are also representing your student colleagues, the academic program you are studying and the wider University. Hence, completing time sheets, interim and post completion online surveys and interim achievement and planning documents contributes to a professional approach.</p><p>• Placements provide you with an opportunity to develop a relationship with a potential employer. However, please note that there are no guarantees that you would be offered employment simply through undertaking your placement.</p><p>Undertaking a practicum placement can be a stressful experience. Whilst a moderate amount of stress is a normal feature of working life, if you need extra support, the University offers a wide range of health and wellbeing support services that can restore and balance your life. Information on these comprehensive health and wellbeing support services can be accessed from: <a href='http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/experience/health' target='_blank' >http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/experience/health</a>.</p><p>Practicum Report</p><p>You are required to complete your Practicum Report in accord with the specific requirements for your Practicum Placement and upload this report to LMS. As the Practicum Report accounts for 60% of your assessment weighting it is the critical task for determining the academic outcome (i.e., pass or fail) of your enrolment in the Social Science Professional Placement unit(s).</p><p>Nevertheless, despite your best efforts, you may find that adverse changes in your health or wellbeing have negatively impacted upon the completion of your practicum placement and/or report. In these circumstances, you may be eligible for ‘special consideration’ which may take the form of an extension for the completion of your practicum placement and/or report. UniAccess is able to provide advice and to assist you to make an application to the Faculty of Arts, Business, Law and Education. However, you must read the conditions attaching to the granting of special consideration before lodging the Application for Special Consideration form. Links to UWA’s policy on the granting of special consideration are as follows: <a href='http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/course/exams/consideration' target='_blank' >http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/course/exams/consideration</a> and <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP11%2F23' target='_blank' >http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP11%2F23</a>.

This may include:</p><p>▪ a critical discussion of the host organisation and its position within your intended industry/career;</p><p>▪ a critical discussion of how your learning to date will influence your approach to the specific role you will be undertaking, and/or</p><p>▪ a critical discussion of how the role might contribute to your learning and career aspirations.</p><p>Please note that your Practicum Report must be consistent with the requirements set this assessment task. Further information is available from the Practicum Report Guidelines document that can be downloaded from LMS.</p><p>Teaching and Learning evaluation</p><p>You may be asked to complete two evaluations during this unit: The Student Perception of Teaching (SPOT) and the Students’ Unit Reflective Feedback (SURF). The SPOT is optional and is an evaluation of the lecturer and the unit. The SURF is completed online and is a university wide survey and deals only with the unit. You will receive an email from the SURF office inviting you to complete the SURF when it is activated. We encourage you to complete the forms as your feedback is extremely important and can be used to make changes to the unit or lecturing style when appropriate.</p></p></pre></p>

The library staff have also developed a tutoring package: ‘A Quick Guide to Using EndNote’ which provides the basics for using EndNote with an essay <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote' target='_blank' >http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote</a></p><p>Acknowledging Sources of Information and ABLE’s Policy on Plagiarism</p><p>Student Services provides an online plagiarism portal that includes a definition of plagiarism and a link to FAQ: www.studentservices.uwa.edu.au/ss/learning/online_services/plagiarism_portal</p><p>‘Turnitin’ Originality Checking and Plagiarism Prevention is used in the Faculty to allow both educators and their students check written work for improper citation or misappropriated content. More information about ‘Turnitin’ can be found at <a href='http://turnitin.com/static/index.html' target='_blank' >http://turnitin.com/static/index.html</a></p></p></pre></p>

Thus, students must follow a work flow process that enables them to enrol in, undertake and report upon their practicum placement in the teaching period that best matches the timing of their practicum.</p><p>Closing dates for lodging an Expression of Interest (EOI) in undertaking a practicum will be published and, unless extenuating circumstances exist, no late submission of an EOI will be accepted.</p><p>Once having their enrolment in WILG2201 approved, a student will engage in the planning and pre-placement activities related to their practicum, undertake a minimum of 100 hours of work experience and complete their Practicum Portfolio.The Practicum Portfolio simply comprises all of the tasks you have undertaken and documents that you have created, of which the Practicum Report is a significant component. Whilst it is envisaged that all of these tasks will be undertaken prior to and during the enrolled teaching period, the timing and taking of the work experience may affect when all requirements are to be completed. Hence, while a Practicum Report is normally to be submitted no later than the Wednesday immediately following the last official examination for the relevant teaching period, a final date for submitting the report will be determined in collaboration with and the approval of the Academic Coordinator.</p><p>The UWA Careers Centre develops students’ awareness, capacity and skills to manage their careers and make a successful transition from academic studies to employment. Students enrolled in WILG2201 are required to complete at least two (2) career-related workshops either conducted by the Careers Centre or an approved external provider. Registration for Careers Centre workshops can be completed at the CareerHub: <a href='https://uwa.careerhub.com.au' target='_blank' >https://uwa.careerhub.com.au</a></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
