Students will be required to attend workshops and engage in discussion, readings, problem solving case studies and online discussion. Participation in workshops will address all the learning outcomes for the unit, focusing on developing both students grasp of Indigenous theory as well as its application to various contexts. In particular participation in workshops will develop learning outcome 4 requiring students to apply indigenous logic with an awareness of learning outcomes 1, 2 and 3.

Problem Solving Case Study

Aside from the case studies in the workshops students will be required to complete a case study individually as part of their assessment. The case study will address the first four learning outcomes and begin the student research journey. It will require students to understand aspects of Indigenous theory and the methods in which they will be applied. This will develop critical thinking skills and competencies in applying indigenous logic.

Comparative Minor Essay

This assessment will require students to write a small essay comparing an aspect of Australian Indigenous knowledge systems with either 1) a Western counterpart or 2) an Indigenous knowledge system in Canada or North America. We will set specific topics in which students can explore this comparison. For example, a student may compare notions of time or evidence. This will help students develop their understanding of learning outcome 3 and 4 and develop a critical understanding of how different concepts are framed within different systems of knowledge. 

Major Research Essay

This assessment requires students to engage in major research essay on a topic relevant to the unit. It addresses all the learning outcomes, but particularly learning outcome 5. Students will have to demonstrate their knowledge of Indigenous principles, processes and features and articulate methods of their application.</td></tr><tr><td> 2 </td><td>understand the diversity as well as the commonalities within different Indigenous systems</td><td>Participation

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>

                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
