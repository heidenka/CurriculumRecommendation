                                    <td>This unit provides an overview of the law and principles of income taxation in Australia. Taxation is ubiquitous in almost all areas of life, not least because it is the key source of public revenue thereby enabling government expenditure, as well as providing a tool for government to influence behaviour, from birth to death. Given the economic, social and political ramifications, any student who wishes to practice as a lawyer or work in business, government, or the not-for-profit sector is well advised to have at least a broad understanding of the Australian taxation system: its sources, functions, content, limits and administration; as well as a theoretical basis to evaluate the system. 

The unit intends to introduce students to these principles in the context of the Australian income tax system; to provide an introduction to the international context of the Australian income tax system; to help students hone the core skills of statutory interpretation and case analysis by applying the content of income tax law to standard transactions; and to provide students with a foundational knowledge of key income tax concepts such as assessable income, deductions and allowances, tax accounting rules for timing and character recognition, and taxable entities. It also engages with current research, comparative perspectives and recent developments in the law to critique the tax system and the tax reform process.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit provides an overview of the law and principles of income taxation in Australia. Taxation is ubiquitous in almost all areas of life, not least because it is the key source of public revenue thereby enabling government expenditure, as well as providing a tool for government to influence behaviour, from birth to death. Given the economic, social and political ramifications, any student who wishes to practice as a lawyer or work in business, government, or the not-for-profit sector is well advised to have at least a broad understanding of the Australian taxation system: its sources, functions, content, limits and administration; as well as a theoretical basis to evaluate the system.</p><p>The unit intends to introduce students to these principles in the context of the Australian income tax system; to provide an introduction to the international context of the Australian income tax system; to help students hone the core skills of statutory interpretation and case analysis by applying the content of income tax law to standard transactions; and to provide students with a foundational knowledge of key income tax concepts such as assessable income, deductions and allowances, tax accounting rules for timing and character recognition, and taxable entities. It also engages with current research, comparative perspectives and recent developments in the law to critique the tax system and the tax reform process.</p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>

The tutorials will also enable you to revise, contextualise and apply the legal and policy principles that are covered in the lectures.</p><p>The JD curriculum has been purposefully designed to scaffold sequential knowledge and skills progression, and may be completed in three years full-time or on a part-time basis. Those who undertake external work, travel or sporting commitments are expected to plan these around their studies. Except in exceptional circumstances, these commitments are not accepted as grounds for a variation in the prescribed sequence of units,* or as valid reasons for timetable changes, the waiving of pre-requisites or variation from the prescribed course structure.* In making a decision as to whether to complete the JD on a full or part-time basis, students must be aware that the estimated time commitment for a standard full-time enrolment is approximately 40 hours per week (over each 12 week semester), excluding examinations. Each unit, including intensive units in non-standard teaching periods, requires an overall time commitment of 150 hours.</p><p>* Students accepted into the UWA Elite Athletes Program, or who undertake exchange or other commitments which involve official representation of the Law School or the University, may seek approval from the Deputy Head of School (Students) for a variation in the prescribed course structure.</p></p></pre></p>

The lectures will be held each Tuesday from 2pm to 4pm and the tutorials will be held alternating weeks Thursday from 4pm to 6pm (beginning in week 2).</p><p>The lectures will be recorded in case you are unable to attend class in exceptional circumstances although I encourage you to attend in person when possible. Unfortunately, I cannot guarantee that the lecture recordings will be successful on every occasion. I will not be re-recording lectures should a recording fail.</p><p>The tutorials are compulsory and will not be recorded. As the tutorials will involve practical group work activities, discussions and problem solving. Tutorial questions will be provided a week ahead of time and I encourage you to prepare for the tutorials in order to get the most out of each tutorial.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

You are allowed to miss one tutorial and this will not impact your mark. Tutorials commence in Week two or three (depending on your group) and will run each week for 1 hour 45 minutes.</p><p>Tutorial marks will be based on participation in class so you need to be well prepared and ready to contribute to discussions. We ask that you come to your tutorial having completed the required reading and having attempted the tutorial questions beforehand.</p><p>How do I enrol in a tutorial?</p><p>Please ensure you have enrolled in a tutorial in the Class Allocation System at www.cas.uwa.edu.au. The Class Allocation System allows you to select your preferred class time. The system will then assign you to a tutorial based on your preferences.</p><p>Can I change tutorials?</p><p>Up until the end of Week 2 , students will be able to change their own class allocations on the Class Allocation System at www.cas.uwa.edu.au. You will only be able to move yourself into the alternative tutorial if there is a space. Spaces may change daily according to student movements. New enrolments can add themselves to classes where there is a space.</p><p>Unfortunately, unit coordinators are not able to take requests from students to be allocated to a specific tutorial or to move students to a different class once assigned as we do not have access to the Class Allocation System. Please contact your Student Office if you have any issues with the Class Allocation System.</p><p>Can I attend a different class for a week?</p><p>Students are required to attend their assigned class. Part-time work, social or other commitments are not grounds for attending an alternative class. In exceptional circumstances, a student will be permitted to attend an alternative class if they have an approved application for special consideration or have an exceptional reason for attending an alternative class (eg. illness) and have obtained the prior permission of the unit coordinator.</p><p>A student who attends an alternative tutorial without prior permission from the unit coordinator will not receive any tutorial marks for that week.</p><p>What happens if I am sick?</p><p>You are allowed to miss one tutorial without any penalty. If you are unable to attend your assigned tutorial for more than one week, you should apply for special consideration.</p><p>Where can I find the tutorial questions?</p><p>The tutorial questions are available on the tutorial section of LMS.</p><p>Marking criteria</p><p>The marking criteria for tutorial participation marks are as follows:</p><p>• engagement,</p><p>• preparation,</p><p>• understanding,</p><p>• reflection; and</p><p>• responsible tutorial membership.</p><p>Engagement will most obviously be in speaking but a student might also be engaged whilst listening. This will be important to note for students who are by nature quieter. They may be engaged, though speak less often.</p><p>Preparation might be evident in notes the student has come with or in the quality of answers and comments in discussion.</p><p>Understanding of the issues raised in tutorials will most commonly be demonstrated though a student’s overall contribution to the tutorial discussion, including small group discussions within a tutorial, whether by way of answering questions, asking questions, making observations, or listening and responding to other students.</p><p>Reflection on the issues (and preparation) might be evident in the student drawing on material outside the material directly related to the tutorial problem, perhaps from other topics in the course and in questions asked during (or even after) the tutorial seminar.</p><p>Responsible tutorial membership refers to the respect given to other student’s comments and refraining from attempting to dominate the discussion.</p><p>Participation is about the quality not necessarily the quantity of contributions (where ‘quality’ means considered and reflective contributions – you are allowed to make mistakes!). The aim of including this component is to encourage unselfconscious discussion amongst students, not an atmosphere of assessment.</p><p>Grade Descriptor</p><p>High Distinction (80% or above) Student attends, is punctual, is exceptionally well-prepared (eg fully prepared answer); demonstrates good understanding of and insightful and/or original reflection on the issues raised in tutorials throughout the semester; critically engages with the subject matter of each tutorial; and consistently demonstrates responsible tutorial membership.</p><p>Distinction (70%-79%) Student attends, is punctual, is well prepared for most tutorials; demonstrates good understanding and reflection on the issues raised in tutorials throughout most of the semester; is engaged with the subject matter of most tutorials; and consistently demonstrates responsible tutorial membership</p><p>Credit (60%-69%) Student attends, is punctual, is well prepared for most tutorials; demonstrates developing understanding of and sound reflection on the issues raised in tutorials throughout most of the semester; is engaged with the subject matter of most tutorials; and demonstrates responsible tutorial membership throughout most of the semester.</p><p>Pass (50%-59%) Student attends and is generally punctual. Student is often not well prepared for tutorials; demonstrates little understanding of or reflection on the issues raised by the tutorials; is not engaged with the subject matter of most tutorials; and shows little responsible tutorial membership.</p><p>Fail (below 50%) Student fails to attend or attends but is late (more than 10 – 15 minutes). Student is not at all prepared; demonstrates little or no understanding of and reflection on the issues raised by the tutorials; is not engaged with the subject matter of any tutorials; and does not demonstrate responsible tutorial membership.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
