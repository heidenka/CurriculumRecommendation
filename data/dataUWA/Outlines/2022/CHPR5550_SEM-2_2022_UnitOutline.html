                        <p><p>If Covid requires restrictions to workshops, then these will be given online Live in Teams. Group project consultations will also be given through Teams. Lecture material will already be online so this will not be affected. If restrictions last until the end of semester, provisions will be made for online group presentations.The project is a capstone experience in which students integrate and apply knowledge and skills</p><p>acquired in earlier units to a substantial real-world design challenge relevant to their discipline.</p><p>Students work in teams, typically with four to six members, and are supervised by an academic and/or</p><p>industry mentor. Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against</p><p>milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project</p><p>are to lead students through a systematic engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare</p><p>them for professional practice as engineers. The focus of the unit is on teamwork skills and the</p><p>design process.</p><p>This is the capstone unit for the Chemical Engineering Degree. It will allow you to bring together</p><p>much of your previously learnt engineering knowledge on a real, practical problem. It contributes 12</p><p>points of the whole year assessment.</p><p>The Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) and the Institution of Engineers Australia (IEAust)</p><p>also place a high priority on this subject as part of your entry into the profession.</p><p>The project is also quite different to the majority of subjects that you have done over the past four</p><p>years. It is a team effort and open ended. Many problems you have faced in your course so far are</p><p>artificially contrived with the solution known to the instructor. In the industrial world you will</p><p>normally work as a team on open-ended projects where communication amongst members is vital.</p><p>There is no ''right'' solution! - just the "best" solution in the time available.</p><p>One of the goals of this subject is to introduce you to such a work process. The staff will endeavour</p><p>to give advice and support to you as you proceed in the project. The group will be managed by its</p><p>members. There needs to be a leader who co-ordinates activities. It is the responsibility of the group</p><p>members to ensure that the project progresses at an appropriate rate. Good communication within the</p><p>group is essential and this will be reflected in your final mark. It will show your efforts at teamwork</p><p>and your ability to communicate your design to academic staff, tutors and engineering consultants.</p></p>

Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against</p><p>milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project</p><p>are to lead students through a systematic engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare</p><p>them for professional practice as engineers. The focus of the unit is on teamwork skills and the</p><p>design process.</p><p>This is the capstone unit for the Chemical Engineering Degree. It will allow you to bring together</p><p>much of your previously learnt engineering knowledge on a real, practical problem. It contributes 12</p><p>points of the whole year assessment.</p><p>The Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) and the Institution of Engineers Australia (IEAust)</p><p>also place a high priority on this subject as part of your entry into the profession.</p><p>The project is also quite different to the majority of subjects that you have done over the past four</p><p>years. It is a team effort and open ended. Many problems you have faced in your course so far are</p><p>artificially contrived with the solution known to the instructor. In the industrial world you will</p><p>normally work as a team on open-ended projects where communication amongst members is vital.</p><p>There is no ''right'' solution! - just the "best" solution in the time available.</p><p>One of the goals of this subject is to introduce you to such a work process. The staff will endeavour</p><p>to give advice and support to you as you proceed in the project. The group will be managed by its</p><p>members. There needs to be a leader who co-ordinates activities. It is the responsibility of the group</p><p>members to ensure that the project progresses at an appropriate rate. Good communication within the</p><p>group is essential and this will be reflected in your final mark. It will show your efforts at teamwork</p><p>and your ability to communicate your design to academic staff, tutors and engineering consultants.</p><p><strong>Your journey toward becoming a Professional Engineer</strong></p><p>The Chemical Engineering Programme of The University of Western Australia is fully accredited by Engineers Australia. This Programme will nurture you toward achieving the Stage 1 Competency Standard for Professional Engineer as stipulated by Engineers Australia. Armed with the Master of Professional Engineering degree in Chemical Engineering, students can aspire eventually to apply for Chartered Professional Engineer status (CPEng) with Engineers Australia.</p><p>The four Stage 1 Competencies are covered by 16 mandatory Elements of Competency and 3 Programme-specific Elements of Competency.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
                    <p>If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend</li>
                        <li>serious injury</li>
                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The full policy and information on applying for special consideration is available at <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">in the UWA Policy Library </a></p>
