It will provide opportunities to (1) develop your knowledge of the Technologies Curriculum and associated teaching strategies, (2) locate and explore a range of digital resources to engage students, (3) create an eportfolio of technology-related evidence to support job applications and ongoing career progression, and (4) increase your personal digital literacies, repertoire of skills, professional networks and confidence with digital technologies as a teaching professional. This unit includes a significant online lecture component that can be completed in your own time prior to the face-to-face tutorial sessions. The online components will prepare you to participate in the face-to-face sessions.</p><p><strong>Technologies Curriculum</strong></p><p>A major focus will be the Western Australian Curriculum: Technologies learning area, Pre-primary to Year 6 and its two distinct, but related, subjects of Design &amp; Technologies, and Digital Technologies. With a focus on 'creating preferred futures', you will explore how Design &amp; Technologies can be integrated into teaching and learning to develop children’s design thinking, and to generate and produce solutions for authentic purposes. As part of Digital Technologies, you will explore a range of computing and mobile technologies, including web 2.0 tools and mobile apps, which are relevant to primary education (and early childhood contexts where applicable). Computational thinking, information systems and pedagogical approaches to support children to define, design and implement digital solutions, will also be explored. Links will be made to the Australian Curriculum Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Capability; and the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (AITSL). This unit’s lecture component will be delivered online through the F-6 Digital Technologies: Foundations MOOC which is a nationally recognized course developed by the University of Adelaide’s Computer Science Education Research Group (CSER). This MOOC will provide you with around 8 hours of accredited professional learning and a certificate of completion mapped to AITSL standards.</p><p><strong>Practical Skills and hands-on exploration</strong></p><p>A key aspect of the face-to-face component of this unit is to provide you with the practical skills you will need to integrate technologies into your teaching and to become a future technology education leader in your professional context. </p><p>A major focus of this unit is also to provide you with hands-on exploration of a range of resources. As part of a group assessment task, you will investigate how practicing teachers integrate aspects of the Technologies Curriculum into their teaching and learning. To support this aim, you will plan and implement a workshop on one of four designated tools. You will also implement your newly acquired skills; you will translate theory into practice by participating in a Technologies Teaching Event with year 1 students at Methodist Ladies College in Claremont on the final day of this unit (Thursday 10th November). This amazing opportunity has been designed to extend your learning in this unit through authentic opportunities for technologies-focused teaching and assessment, and to provide you with experience in best practice use of digital technologies in a classroom setting. </p><p><strong>Digital professional portfolio (Eportfolio)</strong></p><p>To provide evidence that you have met the Technologies-related Australian Professional Graduate Standards for Teachers, a key requirement of this unit is the compilation of a digital professional portfolio. This will be a resource that you will continue to add to and modify as you progress through your teaching career. Graduate Standards 1.2, 2.6, 3.4 and 4.5, along with evidence of your Personal Learning Network (PLN) under Standards 6.4 and/or 7.4, will need to be included. You will draw from on-campus assessments, lessons taught during professional placement, and experience gained through this unit. It will also be important to reflect on the impact of your teaching on student learning related to the above Standards. Your eportfolio, housed within a website platform of your choice, will be suitable for use during a job interview and the skills learned will be transferrable to your future transition from provisional to full registration.</p><p><strong>Increase personal repertoire of digital skills and literacies</strong></p><p>By participating fully in this unit, you will learn about the use of new technologies for the advancement of teacher competencies and educational networking. You will also learn new skills that will be useful in your own teaching and learning. </p><p>You will have access to material compiled by Associate Professor Mark Pegrum on his Digital Learning website in place of a traditional reading list. We thank Mark for making this valuable resource available to us.</p></p></pre></p>

We have a lot of content to cover in a limited number of sessions held in Weeks 1 to 5 of TP4,&nbsp;</span>so be prepared to be available for each morning and afternoon session for at least 2 hours and 45 minutes. On several occasions we will need the full 3-hours, so plan to be in class from 9am to 4pm on each of the five scheduled days. There may be occasions when you are not able to attend a lecture or tutorial. If you cannot attend for any reason, please email me at fiona.mayne@uwa.edu.au as a professional courtesy. Attendance will be recorded for each tutorial session.</p><p>Please make special note of our visit to MLC on Thursday, 10th November where you will implement and assess your teaching plans with Year 1 at MLC. <strong>Please plan ahead to travel to MLC on 10th November </strong>and to meet at 8.50am outside the MLC Early Learning Centre on Corry Lynn Road.</p><p><strong>Pre-unit preparation is strongly suggested</strong></p><p>1.	<strong>Online lecture component.</strong>&nbsp;Assignment 1: Lecture Tasks - Complete CSER Foundations MOOC (Units 1-8) (10 marks). Due: as scheduled in Weeks 1, 2 and 3 before midnight. <i>Please note that the first three modules are due prior to the first class in the first week of the teaching period.</i></p><p>2.	<strong>Group presentation research</strong>. Important: Sign up to a small group via the shared document. Organize the research approach with your team and begin to plan the group presentation and associated hands-on workshop. Conduct research using social media to inform your presentation. Begin as soon as possible and be ready to present on 3 November. <i>Please note that it is essential that each member of the group attends on the day of the presentation.&nbsp;</i></p><p>3.<strong>	Eportfolio preparation.</strong> Start gathering evidence for Graduate Standards 1.2, 2.6, 3.4 and 4.5, and start thinking about 6.4 and 7.4. You will need some evidence (text and images/video) to use on Tuesday 13 October (Session 2) to create (or refine) an eportfolio entry.</p><p>Your engagement with all aspects of this unit, including the online lecture tasks (CSER MOOC) and your presentation/workshop/lesson planning should reflect the expectations of AQF Level 9 (described below). Additional information about assessments will be available under the 'Assessments' tab.</p><p>The unit has been designed to be challenging at AQF Level 9: Masters Degree (Coursework) and is designed for those who have completed Prac A and are in the fourth teaching period of their studies. This means that expectations are high even if you are not yet at this point in your own studies. It also means that all your work on assignments must reflect the appropriate level of thinking. This level of thinking includes being able to reflect critically on theory and professional practice. At this level you will develop the technical and communication skills to design, evaluate, implement, analyse and theorise about developments in technology education that contribute to professional practice or scholarship. It is expected that you will be proactive in locating and drawing on theory related to both pedagogy and technology education. Your submitted assignment work will be judged and marked with AQF Level 9 expectations in mind.</p><p>In terms of your generic skills, this unit aims to help you improve your communication skills as you will be engaging in a lot of written and oral communication; problem-solving and creativity in that you will be thinking of appropriate and creative ways to meet the technology education needs of children; and teamwork in that you will work in groups and teams to bring together a group presentation and demonstration, and through your active, collaborative participation during the workshops.  As in almost every unit you undertake in your MTeach course, your critical thinking skills will be developed as you will evaluate and critique research. When you start looking for employment, employers are very interested in these generic skills.</p></p></pre></p>

This is particularly evident in the delivery and assessment of the Western Australian Curriculum: Technologies learning area, Pre-primary to Year 6 and its two distinct, but related, subjects of Design &amp; Technologies, and Digital Technologies. This assignment involves the completion of the eight units/modules of the nationally accredited University of Adelaide Computer Science Education Research Group (CSER) F-6 Digital Technologies: Foundations MOOC. This MOOC acts as the lecture component of this unit and will provide you with 8 hours of professional learning, plus a certificate of completion mapped to AITSL standards. Completion of the MOOC activities and associated online tasks is designed to develop your background knowledge about concepts and topics in the Digital Technologies curriculum, as well as highlighting practical examples that can be used in the classroom. </p><p><strong>MOOC Lecture Tasks.</strong> This assignment is intended to help you engage with the weekly lecture content and to consolidate your understanding by completing a short activity at the conclusion of each of the eight units (modules). Post your completed task on the appropriate ‘Discussion Forum’ as instructed to showcase your engagement with the ideas presented. Completion of all eight units of the MOOC is a requirement to pass this assignment, and necessary in order to receive your certificate of Professional Learning. (10 marks).<br></p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignment 2 - Group presentation and planning task (40%)</strong></p><p>Connected 21st century students need connected 21st century teachers. Connecting locally and globally through social media, or face-to-face, with practicing teachers who routinely integrate technologies will help you ‘tap into’ an education community that is working to achieve common goals through the sharing of practice, knowledge, innovations and problems. Effective collaboration encourages ongoing observation and feedback, and helps to promote a culture of professional sharing, dialogue, experimentation and constructive critique. Developing your own high quality professional learning culture as part of a personal learning network (PLN), has the potential to enhance student learning outcomes and is an important aspect of your ongoing development as a teacher.</p><p>This assignment is concerned with educational networking, and relates to AITSL Graduate Standards 6.4 and 7.4. The overarching purpose of this assignment is to support the creation of a high-quality PLN, extend your knowledge of digital educational tools and to cultivate a professional learning culture within this unit. You will work together to research (by contacting local and international practicing teachers through social media) how technology is being used in the teaching community (7.4), collaborate to disseminate this knowledge through a group presentation, share innovative practice by creating a lesson and assessment tasks based on the tool, and engage in authentic assessment by teaching and assessing this lesson with a small group of Year 1 students.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Specifically, the aim of Part A of this assignment is to locate practicing teachers who currently use technologies to enhance their teaching, and to use these PLN connections to explore how a particular digital tool can be used effectively in the classroom. The aim of Part B is to develop an interactive presentation and workshop for your peers based on what you learned from your research on this tool. An additional aim of Part B, is to provide you with an authentic opportunity to use technologies to teach, assess and provide feedback in a real-world context.</span></p><p><strong>Part A – Group digital tool research (15 marks) and group presentation (15 marks)</strong><br></p><p>The class will be divided equally into four groups, with each group focusing on one of four set topics. Each member of the group is required to use Web 2.0, social media and other means to find teachers who are using the tool in their classrooms. This is intended to be predominantly an online research task, but personal contacts can also be included. Please be mindful not to harass any one resource (e.g., Facebook’s TeachMeet group). Explain that you are researching for an assignment and use this as a professional opportunity to develop your network.</p><p>Each group will submit a group-generated mind map with an embedded 4-5 minute recorded narration by group members. This mind map and audio narration will highlight key points of the group’s research strategy and how this task impacted each group member’s personal learning network (PLN). This should be uploaded to LMS with a copy of your group’s presentation and demonstration notes as part of the written component submission. During your presentation/workshop, you do not need to talk about how you conducted your research as this will be communicated as part of the mind map submission.</p><p>Note: Aspects of this assessment can be added to your eportfolio as part of the PLN requirements under APST 6.4 or 7.4.</p><p> </p><p>Group members combine what they have found into a <strong>group presentation (30 minutes) </strong>and hands-on <strong>workshop (30 minutes) </strong>to the whole class, addressing the following points related to the AITSL Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (APSTs) Graduate Standards:</p><p>● How is the tool being used in classrooms at various year levels? Provide actual examples with images if possible/appropriate.</p><p>● What teaching strategies are required for this tool to expand student learning? (2.6)</p><p>● How can this tool be used to engage students? (3.4)</p><p>● What are the safe, responsible and ethical use considerations related to integrating this tool into teaching and learning? (4.5)</p><p>● How can the tool be integrated with Design &amp; Technology to create an holistic/integrated learning experience?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p>Each group member should play a role in the presentation which should run for around 30 minutes. A further 30 minutes is allocated for a hands-on demonstration of the tool. You can collect resources from my office to help you become familiar with the tool and to plan your demonstration. Please email me prior. The group presentation PowerPoint and demonstration notes only need to be submitted to LMS once by one group member. </p><p> </p><p>Note: Elements of this assessment can be added to your eportfolio as part of your entries under a range of graduate standards, as mentioned above.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Part B – Group planning task (10 marks)</strong></p><p>Your group will create an integrated learning experience focusing on the Design &amp; Technologies scope and sequence for Year 1. This 45-minute learning experience will use the tool you researched and will be used with Year 1 students at MLC on the final day of this unit in Week 5. This learning experience will be documented using the UWA lesson plan template and submitted as part of the written component.<br></p><p>The planning task must demonstrate links to the Western Australian Curriculum: Technologies learning area and its two subjects of Design &amp; Technologies, and Digital Technologies. It should also incorporate the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Capability.</p><p>The learning experience must include provision for the students to complete a self-evaluation as a <strong>formative assessment task,</strong> and a rubric to score the students against your learning objectives/goals/intensions as a <strong>summative assessment task</strong> at the conclusion of your learning experience. Sample images/copies of these completed and graded assessments will be submitted with the plan. These formative and summative assessments will be discussed and graded in class on the afternoon of the final session (Week 5) and this will form part of your group's submission.</p><p> </p><p>Note: This teaching experience can be documented by group member(s) and can be added to your eportfolio as part of your entries under a range of APSTs such as 2.6 or 3.4.</p><p>Finally, <strong>each group will agree on the weighting that each group member should receive according to their overall contribution </strong>to this assessment task. For example, if the group is awarded 30 marks out of 40. Members who put in a lot of effort can be weighted at 100% and receive a score of 30. Members who do not contribute as much can be weighted at say, 75% and they will receive 75% of 30 marks, and will receive a score of 22.5. This process will be explained in class and is <strong>designed to ensure that marks across the group accurately reflect each person's effort and the quality of their contribution</strong>, as determined by the group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><strong>Assignment 3 - Eportfolio (50%)</strong></p><p>A Digital Professional Portfolio (eportfolio) is a key requirement of the Master of Teaching course. The Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) mandated that all graduates should be in a position to provide evidence that they have met the Graduate Australian Professional Standards for Teachers. Therefore, preservice teachers are required to (a) demonstrate the Graduate Teacher Standards through the successful completion of on-campus assessments and professional experience contexts, and the collation of a digital professional portfolio, and (b) demonstrate impact on student learning as evidenced through the digital professional portfolio and the Graduate Australian Professional Standards. It is expected that the digital professional portfolio will be a resource that you will continue to add to and modify as you progress through the profession.</p><p>The purpose of this assignment is to showcase your accomplishment at the graduate level in the area of Technologies education. It will also encourage ongoing reflective practice to help you to continue to grow as a teacher, and to support job applications and career progression. You will have the opportunity to create ‘evidence stories’ against the technology-related Standards, and to polish your eportfolio.</p><p>The eportfolio will be constructed as a website using a platform of your choice (such as Wix, Weebly, NewGoogleSites) and will be suitable for use to demonstrate your accomplishments during a formal job interview or as part of a job application.</p><p>Your eportfolio will provide evidence that you have met the Technologies-related Graduate Australian Professional Standards for Teachers. Standards that are assessed in this unit comprise Graduate Standard 1.2 (demonstrated as a cited academic research rationale/essay on the use of Technologies for student learning and the implications of Technologies for teaching), technology-related Graduate Standards 2.6, 3.4 and 4.5, and evidence of your Personal Learning Network (PLN) under Standards 6.4 and 7.4.</p><p>You will draw from on-campus assessments, lessons taught during professional practicum placements, and experience/evidence gained through this unit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AUSTRALIAN PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR TEACHERS (APST)<br></p><p><strong>Unit Learning Outcome 1. articulate current theories and research relating to learning with technologies, including web 2.0, web 3.0 and social media tools<br></strong></p><p>APST outcomes:&nbsp;1.2</p><p>Assessed in: Lecture tasks and Eportfolio</p><p><strong>Unit Learning Outcome 2. demonstrate understanding of how to, and how to help children to investigate with ICTs, communicate with ICTs, and create with ICTs</strong></p><p>APST outcomes: 2.6, 3.2, 3.4</p><p>Assessed in:&nbsp;Group presentation and teaching plan </p><p><strong>Unit Learning Outcome 3. demonstrate understanding of how to, and how to help students, parents or carers to, set up, manage and operate web-based and app-based tools</strong></p><p>APST outcomes: 2.6, 3.4</p><p>Assessed in:&nbsp;Group presentation and teaching plan </p><p><strong>Unit Learning Outcome 4. demonstrate understanding of how to, and how to help students, parents or carers to, apply social and ethical protocols and practices when using ICTs, including managing digital safety, privacy and reputation</strong></p><p>APST outcomes: 3.4</p><p>Assessed in:&nbsp;Group presentation and teaching plan, and eportfolio</p><p><strong>Unit Learning Outcome 5. demonstrate an understanding of computational thinking and simple coding/programming, and how to teach it</strong></p><p>APST outcomes: 2.6, 3.4</p><p>Assessed in:&nbsp;Group presentation and teaching plan</p><p><strong>Unit Learning Outcome 6. design learning experiences for teaching the Digital Technologies, and Design and Technologies curriculum area F-6.</strong></p><p>APST outcomes: 2.6, 3.2, 3.4</p><p>Assessed in:&nbsp;Group presentation and teaching plan</p><p><strong>Unit Learning Outcome 7. establish a personal learning network (PLN) to ensure continuing professional development after the end of formal university learning</strong></p><p>APST outcomes: 6.2, 6.4, 7.4</p><p>Assessed in:&nbsp;Group presentation and teaching plan, and eportfolio</p><p><strong>Unit Learning Outcome 8. demonstrate achievement of the technologies-related Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (2.6, 3.4 and 4.5) at the Graduate level</strong></p><p>APST outcomes: 2.6, 3.4, 4.5</p><p>Assessed in:&nbsp;Group presentation and teaching plan, and eportfolio</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>RESUBMISSION RULE</p><p>Failure to pass an assessment item within a unit (MTeach)</p><p>Students must pass all components of a Master of Teaching unit to pass the unit overall.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
