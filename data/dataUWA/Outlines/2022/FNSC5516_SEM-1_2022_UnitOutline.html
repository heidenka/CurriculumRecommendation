                        <p><p>Q: What will happen to the unit in the event of lockdown, masking or stringent social distancing?</p><p>A: in the event of a lockdown, lectures and some tutorial sessions will be moved online with labs/practical sessions deferred (see below).</p><p>Q: What will happen about practical and/or laboratory activates that cannot be undertaken remotely or online?</p><p>A: these will be block taught at the end of the semester and/or when appropriate advice allows us to do so safely following relevant Government mandates. Final examination dates may need to be moved accordingly to allow appropriate revision/preparation time.</p><p>Q: What will happen to the unit in the event of staff absence due to COVID-related reasons?</p><p>A: Where possible we will use replacement lecturer(s) and demonstrators. If this is not possible, we will move to an online delivery (where possible) and defer other activities (see above).</p><p>Q: What the implications for students in the unit are if they get COVID or have to self-isolate due to close contact?</p><p>A: Students are eligible for two-weeks special consideration as detailed above. This is intended to provide the required extensions to any assessable materials and/or practical activities. Any student having to isolate during testing or for other reasons will have access to streamed lectures via TEAMS (by prior arrangement with the unit coordinator). The relevant materials for missed practical session(s) will be provided at an alternative time.</p></p>

The basic underpinning of the discipline is thus largely grounded in a sound anatomical knowledge of the anatomy of the human skeleton, including the dentition. Casework requirements will vary and are often unpredictable, therefore being able to identify a complete and intact skeleton (whilst important) is not enough – a competent anthropologist must be able to identify small bone fragments, reconcile commingling, determine human from non-human animal origin, reconstruct fragmentary remains, and understand appropriate mensuration and documentation methods.</p><p>This unit is intended to introduce students to basic ideas and principles in forensic osteology, including: basic knowledge of the embryological origin of the human skeleton; basics of bone growth and development; dental anatomy, charting and odontometrics; regional anatomy of the human skeleton (skull and teeth; thorax and pelvis; vertebral column; and the appendages); bone measurement and morphological quantification; repair and reconstruction; casting and three-dimensional scanning. The unit will also provide practical experience in correct handling techniques and methods for casting and reconstructing of human skeletal remains. It is envisioned that students will develop an appreciation of the importance of a sound anatomical knowledge of the human skeleton as it relates to requisite casework referred to the forensic anthropologist.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>LECTURE SERIES</p><p>Lecture 1: The language of anatomy and introductory osteology</p><p>In this session an overview to the unit is first provided. Thereafter the first part of the lecture discusses the origins of anatomical terminology and its importance in modern forensic practice. Relevant directional and sectional terminology is also introduced. In the second part of the lecture, skeletal anatomy and concepts relating to the post-mortem alteration of bones are examined. Basic principles relating to correct bone handling procedures will be discussed. </p><p>Lecture 2: Juvenile osteology</p><p>The purpose of this lecture is to introduce concepts relating to the embryological origins of the human skeleton. Aspects of skeletal growth, specifically intramembranous and endochondral ossification are also considered. The anatomy of the fetal skeleton is introduced and thereafter a regional approach is taken to explore the morphology of the juvenile skeleton – birth through adolescence.</p><p>Lecture 3: Overview of forensic odontology</p><p>This is the first of two lectures presented by the state forensic odontologist, Dr Stephen Knott. In this lecture, Dr Knott will explain the importance of dental evidence as it relates to forensic investigations. The teeth hold evidentiary value not only in personal identification, but also in linking (or eliminating) suspects to a bite-mark left in a victim or at a scene of a crime, as a repository for molecular material suitable for genetic identification, a record of health during life, and as a marker of personal age. Dr Knott will explore the discipline by drawing on his many years of service in broad applications ranging from routine casework through to deployment in response to mass-death scenarios (e.g., disaster victim identification).</p><p>Lecture 4: Human identification</p><p>This is the second of two lectures presented by the state forensic odontologist, Dr Stephen Knott. In this lecture, Dr Knott focuses on the role of the forensic dentist in relation to personal identification. The teeth are one of only a small and restricted number of biological indicators of identity that are deemed admissible for legal purposes. The lecture will consider the methods applied to establish identity based on the dentition. In addition, the lecture will also explore the specific reasons why establishing personal identity is so important (e.g., closure to families; settlement of estates; amongst others).</p><p>Lecture 5: Dental anatomy</p><p>The purpose of this lecture is to specifically consider the development and anatomy of the human dentition. The embryological origins of the teeth are explored and their growth and development thereafter from birth through to early adolescence is discussed. The relevant nomenclature used to describe the jaws and teeth within is explained, as are the various methods available for dental charting. The interpretation of orthopantomograms (OPGs) is introduced, as are concepts relating to the measurement of the dentition (odontometrics), either digitally or in physical specimens. The lecture concludes by exploring variations in the dentition that relate to pathology or developmental anomalies, and the methods used to quantify attrition.</p><p>Lecture 6: Documentation of human skeletal remains</p><p>The documentation of human skeletal remains by the forensic anthropologist is one of the most fundamental tasks performed; it facilitates most of the analyses and interpretations that follow. The purpose of this lecture is to consider the multifaceted types of documentation performed and explore the most appropriate methods for doing so. When skeletal remains are referred to the anthropologist, one of the first requirements is inventorying. The latter is considered, as are aspects relating to the stabilization of fragmentary remains. The specific methods, and the specialized equipment, used to measure human skeletal remains are discussed. As most material referred to the anthropologist will at some point be returned to the investigating authority (e.g., for subsequent burial), the lecture will conclude by considering the importance of alternate methods of  documenting remains that facilitate further ‘virtual’ analysis of those remains should the need arise.</p><p>PRACTICAL SERIES</p><p>Practical 1: Introductory osteology</p><p>This laboratory will facilitate your knowledge of individual bones and important features of the human skeleton. In this session you will learn the appropriate techniques for handling bones, in addition to the primary skeletal features necessary to understand and apply the methods of analysis presented in subsequent lectures (e.g. formulating a biological profile; age, sex, stature and ancestry).</p><p>Practical 2: Regional anatomy</p><p>This laboratory is split into three weekly sections: 2.1 – the skull; 2.2 – thorax, vertebral column and pelvis; 2.3 – the appendages. Each is allocated a specific weekly practical session time designed to develop your detailed knowledge of regional anatomy. In these sessions you will apply a selection of techniques that will be built upon in advanced units for the assessment of skeletal remains and the formation of a biological profile.</p><p>Practical 3: Juvenile anatomy</p><p>This laboratory will develop your ability to identify bones in the human subadult skeleton and thus achieve an understanding of growth and development of human remains. In this session you will seriate juvenile bone by size and developmental stage, through the quantification of physical specimens and medical images. Identification of fetal bone is not only important for estimating age, and understanding growth and development (both normal and anomalous), but also in differentiating human from non-human bone. </p><p>Practical 4: Forensic odontology</p><p>This laboratory will develop your dental anatomy background, including an understanding of morphological variation, changes with age and development, and dental pathology. In this session you will apply a selection of techniques for the study of teeth in forensic and physical anthropological contexts. </p><p>Practical 5: Measurement and recording</p><p>This laboratory will develop your ability to create a permanent record of the human remains being analysed. In this session you will apply a selection of techniques for acquiring three-dimensional representations of skeletal and/or dental elements. You will also learn how to take basic skeletal measurements using the appropriate landmarks, definitions and equipment.</p><p>Practical 6: Fragments and burnt bone</p><p>This laboratory will test your understanding of skeletal and dental anatomy by identifying elements that have undergone post-mortem modifications such as fragmentation and burning. You will be required to identify landmarks on, and attempt to reconstruct fragmented bones as well as identify fragments of further anthropological interest.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
