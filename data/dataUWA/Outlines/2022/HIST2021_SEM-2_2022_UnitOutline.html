Through collaboration with the State Records Office of Western Australia and the State Library of Western Australia, which hold many relevant records and provide access to users, the unit will comprise a series of case studies including hands-on workshops, giving students work integrated and practice-led experience. Students explore both 1., how to do biographical research and write their own family history and/or a globally and culturally diverse biography, as well as 2., how to use these skills in producing other forms of history, including public history. Students are introduced to the relevant sources, information, and techniques employed by family historians in constructing genealogies, including oral interviews, historical records, and photographs, to obtain information about a family and to demonstrate kinship of its members.  Key themes are the exploration of global and historical processes of migration and identity-building through tracing family histories, from local to global.</td>

Through collaboration with the State Records Office of Western Australia and the State Library of Western Australia, which hold many relevant records and provide access to users, the unit will comprise a series of case studies including hands-on workshops, giving students work integrated and practice-led experience. Students explore both 1., how to do biographical research and write their own family history and/or a globally and culturally diverse biography, as well as 2., how to use these skills in producing other forms of history, including public history. Students are introduced to the relevant sources, information, and techniques employed by family historians in constructing genealogies, including oral interviews, historical records, and photographs, to obtain information about a family and to demonstrate kinship of its members. Key themes are the exploration of global and historical processes of migration and identity-building through tracing family histories, from local to global.</p><p>Outcomes: Students are able to (1) develop sound arguments about how the lives of migrants to Australia over the last 230 plus years has been shaped by historical contexts (social, political, economic, cultural, and environmental); (2) describe the historical and cultural processes leading to the global movement and migration of individuals, families and social groups to Australia over the last 230 plus years, through the medium of a family history; (3) demonstrate an understanding of a range of key historical debates that contextualise family history and its cognate historical fields; (4) identify a range of key resources relevant to family history; (5) articulate arguments in verbal and written communication; and (6) reference written work in accordance with the History guide to documentation of sources.<br></p></p></pre></p>

You will also be asked to lead discussion on one reading during the semester (see below). You will be expected to prepare for each workshop and contribute to the discussion. Workshop participation assessment will evaluate:</p><p>1.  Attendance.  You’ll receive credit for attendance, but perfect attendance without much participation will result in no more than a ‘pass’ (50-59 per cent).  Systematic non-attendance at workshops without a valid explanation may result in failure. </p><p>2.  Participation.  You’ll be assessed on the quantity and quality of your participation in workshop discussion. Lots of participation that doesn’t reflect preparation or insight won’t do you much good, but even a few well-prepared and insightful interventions during most sessions will gain a very good mark.  Consistent participation reflecting genuine insight and close engagement with the readings will result in a very high mark indeed.  </p><p>Workshops are a collective experience. Particularly high marks will be awarded to students who stimulate discussion and encourage others to participate. Overriding others or aggression will be penalised.</p><p>LEADING DISCUSSION. Each student will choose a reading from the list of required readings for which they will lead discussion in the relevant week. The list will be shared in workshops and in LMS. You are asked to present, </p><p>1.	 a short summary of the text’s argument, considering questions such as ‘what is the author arguing?’, ‘what kind of evidence have they used to support their argument?’, ‘what method(s) have they used to analyse their data?’. Summarise their argument, and evaluate how persuasive or effective they are. After this short analysis (around 5-7 minutes is fine), you will </p><p>2.	lead discussion among the larger group, by posing questions prompted by the reading in the context of the weekly topic. If the workshop is large, we may break into smaller groups to discuss your thought-provoking questions or provocations. The group will then report back or share the outcomes of our discussion.</p><p>EACH STUDENT IS EXPECTED TO READ ALL THE REQUIRED READINGS EACH WEEK.</p></p></pre></p>

During recent years, this debate has evoked increasing interest in the role of peasants and artisans in the development of nineteenth-century socialist politics, particularly during the rise of socialism in France.1 Indeed, it has been asserted that ‘the first great wave of socialist militancy depended upon farmers and self-employed skilled workers.’2 Certainly the socialist movement in southern France in the 1890s appears to have evolved from the peasantry, who provided at least sixty percent of its electoral support.3 Unfortunately, many of the most important aspects of this phenomenon remain unexplored.4 The evidence, however, contradicts Marx’s assertion that ‘the proletariat alone is the really revolutionary class.’5</p><p>Notes</p><p>1 See, for instance, Christopher H. Johnson, “Communism and the Working Class Before Marx: The Icarian Experience,” American Historical Review 76, no. 3 (June 1971): 642-689, <a href='https://doi.org/' target='_blank' >https://doi.org/</a> 10.2307/1851621; and William H. Sewell, “Property, Labor and the Emergence of Socialism in France,” in Consciousness and Class Experience in Nineteenth-Century Europe, ed. John Merriman (New York: Holmes &amp; Meier Publishers, 1979), 45-63.</p><p>2 Bernard H. Moss, The Origins of the French Labor Movement 1830-1914: The Socialism of Skilled Workers (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980), 47.</p><p>3 Moss, Origins of the French Labor Movement, 231.</p><p>4 This insufficiency is particularly characteristic of research on the relationship between the new socialist politics and the older republican tradition.</p><p>5 Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1967), 41, cited in Johnson, “Communism and the Working Class,” 643.</p><p>Bibliography</p><p>Johnson, Christopher H. “Communism and the Working Class Before Marx: The Icarian Experience.” American Historical Review 76, no. 3 (1971): 642-689. <a href='https://doi.org/' target='_blank' >https://doi.org/</a> 10.2307/1851621.</p><p>Moss, Bernhard H.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980.</p><p>Sewell, William H. “Property, Labor and the Emergence of Socialism in France.” In Consciousness and Class Experience in Nineteenth-Century Europe, edited by John Merriman, 45-63. New York: Holmes &amp; Meier Publishers, 1979.</p><p>There are five footnotes for a single paragraph in this example, which has been rather artificially constructed for illustrative purposes. This density of referencing may occasionally be appropriate in your essays, but would normally be too much of a good thing. It would be a rare paragraph of an essay, however, which would not require at least one citation of a source.</p><p>It is best to use the automatic footnote facility to create footnotes (ask your tutor if you don’t know how to use it), though they can also be created manually. Reference numbers should be superscript (as in the example above), and it is usually best to place them at the end of the relevant sentence or paragraph. The notes to which the numbers refer may be placed at the bottom of the page (footnotes) or at the end of the essay (endnotes). We prefer footnotes, but you will not be penalised for using endnotes instead. Number your notes consecutively (notes 1 to 43 throughout your essay, not notes 1 to 3 on p. 1, 1 to 5 on p. 2, 1 to 4 on p. 3 and so on). Historians usually use notes rather than in-text referencing styles (such as Harvard), because they allow for the inclusion of more detail, which is particularly useful when citing unpublished sources such as archival documents.</p><p>You should notice that the first sentence of the ‘mini-essay’ does not have a reference. Generally accepted factual material does not require a citation to support it: we don’t need a source to reassure us that Hitler is a controversial figure or that World War I broke out in 1914.</p><p>Note 1 in the example above is a ‘bibliographical note’ referring to a body of literature. A statement such as ‘there has been an increasing amount of interest’ or ‘some historians have suggested’ would normally require such a reference. This note and the next also illustrate formats for references to the three major varieties of sources: a book (Moss), a journal article (Johnson), and a contribution to an edited collection (Sewell). When citing a contribution to an edited collection, you must always cite both the contribution itself (in this case William H. Sewell, “Property, Labor and the Emergence of Socialism in France”) and the collection in which it appeared (here Consciousness and Class Experience in Nineteenth-Century Europe, ed. John Merriman (New York: Holmes &amp; Meier Publishers, 1979)). You will also see that where you wish to cite more than one source in a footnote, you should separate them with semi-colons.</p><p>Quotations must always have a reference, as in note 2. Where you are referencing a quotation or specific idea, you must give the page number/s on which this quote or idea appears (rather than the entire page range for the article or chapter). Note 3 shows you how to refer to a work which has already been referred to in a preceding note. You must give the author’s last name and shortened version of the title, as well as the necessary page reference, but should not mention any other bibliographical information. In the past it was common to use the Latin terms op.cit. or ibid. (so that the reference would have read: Moss, ibid., 47.), but these Latinisms are falling out of favour, and you should use the short title format instead. Statistics must always be referenced, as with note 3.</p><p>Not all notes include a citation. Some may develop a point which is worth mentioning, but which is too peripheral to be included in the body of the essay, as with note 4. You can overuse this form, since there is a narrow range between including material in such a note which would best be omitted altogether or, alternatively, should have been included in the body of the essay.</p><p>Note 5 shows how you should cite material which was itself cited in one of your sources. It would be unacceptable in this case to simply cite Johnson, and it would be dishonest to simply cite the Manifesto, since you had not consulted this source in the original. You will notice that this reference to Johnson is another short title citation, since this source was used in note 1.</p><p>Finally, every history essay must include a bibliography listing all the sources used. These must be alphabetised by author’s surname. Note that although the bibliographical information included is the same as for the first citation of a work in the notes, the format of bibliographical entries is quite different from that of the notes. It is important to follow the conventions for both notes and bibliography precisely. Note that in your bibliography, you must provide the full page range for journal articles and chapters in edited books.</p><p>The above examples of referencing do not exhaust the problems that arise in citing sources and compiling bibliographies. Please consult your tutor if you have any questions.</p><p>Part 2: A guide to citation style</p><p>During your time at university, you should become familiar with a range of different citation styles. In our history units, we ask you to use Chicago style, which is widely used in published works, and relatively straightforward.</p><p>Examples of how to cite a book, a journal article, and a contribution to an edited collection appear above. You should note carefully the order in which information about the book appears, and the use of commas, full stops, quotation marks, parentheses and italics.</p><p>A full guide to citing a wide range of materials using Chicago style is available on the UWA library website at <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/Chicago_citation' target='_blank' >http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/Chicago_citation</a></p><p> </p><p></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
                    <p>If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend</li>
                        <li>serious injury</li>
                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
                    </ul>
