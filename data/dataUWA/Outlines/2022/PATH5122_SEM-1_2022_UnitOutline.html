                        <h3>Teaching contingency plan (In response to Covid19 restrictions)</h3>
                        <p><div>To the extent feasible, PATH5122 will proceed with face-to-face teaching. Students will be expected to attend PATH5122 classes when it’s safe to do so. However, given that community transmission of COVID-19 is occurring in WA (as of mid February 2022), it's forseeable that some classes may be disrupted, possibly at short-notice. For example, a lecturer may be required to isolate, or a guest lecturer may be required to manage emergency activities relating to COVID-19 testing, or government restrictions may prevent face-to-face gatherings…among other possibilities. It is also likely that even for sessions that can proceed, one or more students may be absent due COVID-like symptoms or may be required to isolate.</div><div><p><br> </p></div><p>The COVID-19 situation is likely to be fluid and unpredictable this semester. So before setting out to attend a PATH5122 session, make a point to check your email or LMS for announcements. If a session needs to be rearranged at short notice, an announcement will be posted to LMS and circulated to student email accounts.</p><p>There’s no denying that the COVID-19 situation will present many challenges, and may be stressful at times. Try to keep in mind that it’s also an opportunity for you to foster resilience and a capacity to negotiate your way through changing circumstances. As such, it can present a unique and rich opportunity for learning and development. </p><p>Fortunately, the small cohort size for PATH5122 allows for a lot of flexibility and agility in responding to changing conditions. In 2020 when COVID emerged and we were all scrambling to learn Zoom and Teams, we found a way through the PATH5122 unit - and it turned out to be a surprisingly fun and effective way to teach and learn biochemistry.</p><p><u><b>Lectures</b></u></p><p>If circumstances prevent a PATH5122 lecture from proceeding face-to-face, the lecture will either proceed as a live-stream via LMS Teams, or it will be postponed to a more suitable time. If neither of these options are viable, a pre-recorded screen-capture recording (with audio) will be posted to LMS.</p><p>Note that if a real-time lecture can proceed (either face-to-face or live-streamed) a screen-capture recording (with audio) will be posted to LMS within 24 hours, as you would be used to from PATH5121.</p><p>If you know you’re going to be absent from a face-to-face lecture, and you would like to follow the lecture online in real time, you may email the unit coordinator to request a live-stream via MS Teams. If the request can be facilitated, a link to the live-stream will be posted into the corresponding folder in LMS. However, please understand that this may not always be feasible. This option should not be used to replace a face-to-face lecture when it’s otherwise safe for you to attend.</p><p><u><b>Tutorials</b></u></p><p>If circumstances prevent a face-to-face PATH5122 tutorial from proceeding, the unit coordinator will advise alternative arrangements via LMS and student emails. Some tutorials may be suitable for delivery online as a live-stream through MS Teams; other tutorials might be better adapted as a self-directed exercise using resources posted in LMS. Arrangements will be made as the needs arise, and will be announced via LMS and email, as above for lectures.</p><p>Note that unlike lectures, PATH5122 tutorials will not normally be recorded. However, if you’re expecting to be absent from a tutorial, you may email the unit coordinator to find out if a live stream via MS Teams can be arranged, This option should not be used to replace a face-to-face tutorials when it’s otherwise safe for you to attend.</p><p><u><b>Laboratory Exercises</b></u></p><p>There are three laboratory exercises scheduled for PATH5122. There will be a written assessment associated with each, typically due about 2 weeks after the session. There are also two sessions reserved as catch-up slots later in the semester, in case COVID-19 circumstances prevent individuals or the whole class from attending earlier laboratory sessions. </p><p>If the COVID-19 situation prevents a student (or the class as a whole) from attending any of the laboratory exercises, including a catch-up session, then those affected will be provided with data for the assessment.</p><p><u><b>Quizzes</b></u></p><p>There are 5 quizzes scheduled during the semester for PATH5122 (similar to the format for quizzes in PATH5121). Quizzes will be conducted face-to-face whenever it’s possible. Students who are unable to attend a quiz may be rescheduled according to Special Considerations processes through Student Experience. </p><p>In the event that the unit coordinator is unable to attend a scheduled quiz, the quiz will be invigilated by other university staff, for marking by the unit coordinator. </p><p>If a quiz cannot be conducted on-site as scheduled, it will either be postponed, or it may be adapted as an online quiz through LMS. Any online quizzes will have time restrictions, and may be invigilated remotely by the unit coordinator (eg, via MS Teams).</p><p><u><b>Final Exam</b></u></p><p>In the event that the final exam cannot be conducted in-person as scheduled, it will be postponed to a suitable date.</p></p>

See the University guide for more information: <a href='https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/referencinguwa' target='_blank' >https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/referencinguwa</a></p><p>The practice of using websites as references should be avoided in general. Always consider material on the internet with scepticism, as it is unlikely to have been reviewed.

Students unable to attend face-to-face sessions can request for the session to be broadcast live via Teams by emailing the unit coordinator. Where practically feasible, these requests will be facilitated. Lectures will also be recorded and posted to LMS.
Similarly, if students are unable to attend a tutorial, they are encouraged to contact the unit coordinator to request for the session to be broadcast via Teams, although some tutorial sessions may not be suitable for this format. In any event, the relevant material for  tutorials will be posted on LMS, including solutions if relevant, after the session is complete.
Catch-up sessions may be available for missed laboratory sessions, otherwise students will be provided with data for laboratory reports. </p></pre></p><br />

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
