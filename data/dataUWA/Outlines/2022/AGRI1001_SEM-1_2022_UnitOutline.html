You will explore the drivers of global food security You will be introduced to the major foods produced around the world and some of the fascinating ways in which agriculture, culture and diet are intertwined. The major Australian agricultural systems will be introduced. You will review the roles that agricultural innovation, emerging technologies and research will have in adaptation to challenges such as global warming and increasing global population and affluence. Means to improve environmental outcomes will be emphasised. You will also learn how changing community preferences and expectations of healthy eating, animal welfare, and safety and acceptability of new and emerging technologies are impacting agricultural systems. You will view research projects currently underway at UWA and interact with UWA researchers who are having global impact. You will engage with the agricultural sector by visiting commercial farms, as well as meet and interact with Western Australian farmers and industry leaders.</td>

You will explore the drivers of global food security You will be introduced to the major foods produced around the world and some of the fascinating ways in which agriculture, culture and diet are intertwined. The major Australian agricultural systems will be introduced. You will review the roles that agricultural innovation, emerging technologies and research will have in adaptation to challenges such as global warming and increasing global population and affluence. Means to improve environmental outcomes will be emphasised. You will also learn how changing community preferences and expectations of healthy eating, animal welfare, and safety and acceptability of new and emerging technologies are impacting agricultural systems. You will view research projects currently underway at UWA and interact with UWA researchers who are having global impact. You will engage with the agricultural sector by visiting commercial farms, as well as meet and interact with Western Australian farmers and industry leaders.<br></p></p></pre></p>

There will also be a diversity of viewpoints on many of the issues that will be discussed. We encourage all students to share their knowledge and experiences in a respectful manner to assist everyone to broaden their knowledge and understanding. To aid this objective the unit is structured as a single 3-hour interactive workshop every week with associated on-line pre-recorded lectures and exercises in the LMS. Attendance is compulsory and participation encouraged. It is important to come to the workshops well-prepared with all on-line (LMS) material for that week already viewed. A range of activities will happen in the workshops including visits to research projects, discussion of readings, and interactions with industry guests. There will be two fieldtrips.  The first fieldtrip will be on a Saturday to an innovative broadacre commercial cropping-livestock farm near Pingelly. The second fieldtrip will be in the workshop timeslot: content may vary year to year. Attendance on fieldtrips is compulsory and will help you overall understanding of core concepts covered in the unit. Throughout the unit, we will consider and discuss current affairs in agriculture. You may wish to join the class Facebook group, UWA AGRI1001, where media articles will be posted.  However, this is not compulsory. <br></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
