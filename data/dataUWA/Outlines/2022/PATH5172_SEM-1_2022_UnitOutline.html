                        <h3>Teaching contingency plan (In response to Covid19 restrictions)</h3>
                        <p><p>This unit includes theoretical and practical knowledge as well a significant skill development. While much of the underpinning knowledge (i.e. lecture material) may be accessed asynchronously through the LMS, a significant face-to-face component (i.e. tutorials and laboratory practical classes) is required for development of critical thinking, problem solving and practical laboratory skill development required by professional accreditation standards.</p><p>Students are expected to attend face to face classes when they are scheduled. Adherence to state and university directions relating to mask use, proof of vaccination, social distancing and all other safety measures are required to attend campus.</p><p>To support student theoretical learning during asynchronous delivery, the unit coordinator is available for consultation weekly during the office hours listed above.</p><p>In the event of widespread restrictions to campus access or limitations on venue capacity, some face-to-face classes may be converted to synchronous but online activities. However, activities that require interaction of students with laboratory equipment, specialist staff, laboratory reagents or samples, including but not limited to practical competency assessments, cannot be converted to an online activity. Efforts will be made to complete these classes on time with increased protections and / or reduced room occupancy. Where this is not possible, classes may be deferred until restrictions ease, including potential deferral of classes and / or assessments beyond the semester.</p><p>Accommodations have been made in anticipation of some staff absences due to mandatory isolation and / or illness to allow scheduled practical classes to continue. However, significant unexpected staff absences may disrupt the planned schedule, resulting in deferral of some classes or assessments. Where this occurs students will be notified by email and LMS announcement of both the cancellation and the new schedule as early as possible.</p><p>Laboratory and tutorial classes are not routinely recorded and usually cannot feasibly be repeated or deferred to accommodate individual students. However, students who are unable to attend a required face to face class due to mandatory isolation, illness or other awarded special consideration will be provided class notes and other available resources related to the class and may avail themselves of office hours consultation where further support is needed. Students who miss a scheduled on campus assessment and are awarded special consideration may be offered alternative assessment where feasible, or have their assessment deferred, including deferral beyond the semester.</p></p>

Practical classes are compulsory and form the main body of the unit. These are complemented by online learning packages centred on specific clinical laboratory skills and problem-solving tutorials. These include reading material on clinical laboratory procedures, videos and commentaries. Laboratory data interpretation exercises and revision quizzes are delivered online. 

The unit is structured into three blocks followed by an intensive revision week: (1) intensive core skills course—daily laboratory sessions in biosafety, applied microscopy, microbial identification, antimicrobial sensitivity tests, molecular diagnostic methods; (2) identification of infectious agents—bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites; (3) clinical specimen categories—sterile sites, genitourinary, respiratory, soft tissue, gastrointestinal; and (4) intensive practical revision (1 week).</td>

The main body of the unit are practical classes that are compulsory. These are complemented by online learning packages and problem solving tutorials including reading material on clinical laboratory procedures, videos, lectures and commentaries. The unit is structured into three blocks each followed by an intensive revision test: Block A - intensive core skills course in biosafety, applied microscopy, microbial identification, antimicrobial sensitivity testing and molecular diagnostic methods; Block B - identification of infectious agents by taxonomy - bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites; Block C - clinical specimen categories - sterile sites, urogenital, respiratory and soft tissue. There are three revision tests: A, B and C. Revision tests A and B are designed to cover the first two teaching blocks, respectively. This allows monitoring of students’ progress during the semester. Revision test C is held in the final week of the semester, just before the exam. This final revision test allows students to apply the knowledge and practical skills gained through the course to identifying and characterising infectious agents in simulated clinical specimens spiked with unknown microorganisms. Revision test C is followed by a practical exam that is structured similar to the revision test. There is a supplementary exam for those who do not pass the exam.</p></pre></p>

Fridays are reserved for wrap-up or revision tests. The classes are primarily practical through which students will be guided by tutorials/manual and demonstrations. Students will have the opportunity to perform most of the diagnostic tests themselves with the help of UWA academics and professional industry staff. At the end of each week, students will be given opportunity to discuss/troubleshoot the topic in the Wrap-up sessions F2F or online. During the Covid pandemics, all visits to clinical diagnostic laboratories at PathWest are cancelled.</p></pre></p>

In Block A, we teach diagnostic core skills that will be applied in Blocks B and C. In Block B, students learn how to identify microorganisms according to their taxonomic affiliation in four main categories: bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. In Block C, we teach clinical specimen categories, their handling, clinical diagnostic procedures, result interpretation and reporting. Each block has four topics that are introduced on Mondays, while classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays are exclusively practical. Friday classes are used to complete practical work and wrap-up theoretical training.</p></pre></p>

Efforts will be made to complete these classes on time with increased protections and / or reduced room occupancy. Where this is not possible, classes may be deferred until restrictions ease, including potential deferral of classes and / or assessments beyond the semester.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
