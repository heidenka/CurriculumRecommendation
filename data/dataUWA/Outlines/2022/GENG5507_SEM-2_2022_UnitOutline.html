                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit develops students’ technical and statistical skills in risk and reliability, and also covers the social and organisational contexts which are so important in ensuring that products and services are designed, constructed and operated safely and reliably. The unit is taught with all the engineering disciplines in one class to reinforce the need for cross-discipline collaboration in risk, reliability, and safety management. The statistical elements complement the engineering material and enable the students to develop statistical skills to perform calculations in these fields. The unit focuses on  the use of contemporary risk, reliability, and safety practices used in industry today.</p></p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Lecture Capture System</h3>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>The T&amp;L approach in this unit involves both flipped and traditional learning. There is a video recording in the Unit Admin Folder in LMS called "Course Overview and How to succeed in this unit" that describes the course motivation and design. Please watch this video.</p><p>The statistics part of this unit, which coverers essential probability and statistics concepts to understand the engineering content in the unit, is taught in weekly lectures and practice class sessions with facilitator support. New concepts are introduced in the lecture, reinforced with worked examples in the practice classes and assessed in a weekly statistics quiz. Students usually make extensive use of the Stats discussion boards. There is one for each week.</p><p>The engineering content of this unit is delivered in a flipped classroom workshop. In a flipped learning environment it is the responsibility of the students to do work prior to the workshop in the form of readings, pre-recorded lectures and videos so that they are ready to deploy and practice these ideas in the workshop. The pre-work is material/ content delivery that you can absorb in your own time over the 14 days before the workshop. You also have 14 days to do the assessed weekly Eng quiz questions. These questions are found in the Pre-work folder.</p><p>The Eng workshop is where you get a chance to think about the material you have covered in the pre-work and use it to solve an engineering problem, usually in the form of a case study. Workshops are designed to allow you to engage with the materials, learn how to use the ideas, test you understanding of them and how they are applied. During the workshop we often have one or two workshop quizzes of 1-2 multiple choice questions each. These Eng workshop quizzes are NOT assessed. They are primarily a) to track attendance, and b) to see if attendees have got some point that is being discussed. If you are not at the Eng workshop you don't need to worry about these, but there are always those who don't want to miss out and so we do post them for online participants as well. Remember Eng workshop quizzes are not assessed but the Eng weekly quizzes in the Pre-work folders are. </p><p>Conversation and exchange of ideas with the Eng workshop coordinator and other students is a key feature of the workshop environment. Risk concepts are not black and white and the risk management process needs to be practiced. Obviously this is best done in a face to face environment but where students cannot make the engineering workshops in person they are encouraged to have discussions on line using the discussion boards. The discussion boards take the place of practice classes for the engineering content. There is one for each week.</p><p>This unit makes extensive use of online discussion boards on LMS. These support dialog with the workshop leaders, teaching team and with other students. Take time to work out how these work, for example see the video link mentioned above. You are encouraged to both post questions and help your peers with their questions. Explaining to others is a good way to validate your own understanding.</p></p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Unit Structure</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p><strong>General:</strong></p><p>We have made a recording in the Unit Admin folder called "Course design and how to succeed in this course". Can we suggest you watch it as it describes the unit structure. </p><p>The unit is taught by two professionals, one teaching the engineering content in flipped learning mode and the other teaching the statistics content in regular lecture-practical mode. The engineering content leverages the statistics content and vice-versa but each is taught by experts in their core fields.</p><p>1. Engineering content: One ~2.5 hour interactive Engineering workshop per week. Note a 3 hour time slot is allowed for in the timetable but usually workshops run 1.75-2.25 hours. Other weekly commitments include pre work (reading and watching recordings) and a weekly assessed Engineering quiz.</p><p>2. Stats content: Stats Lectures: 2 hours per week; Stats practical classes: 1 hour per week. See Timetable for time slots, please register for one practical class [Practice class starts in Week 2]. Other weekly commitments include  a weekly assessed Stats quiz.</p><p>Our expectation is that this unit will require up to 8 hours of time commitment/ week on average. The unit is front end loaded with much of the work happening in the first 8 weeks of semester allowing you time towards the end of semester to focus on deliverables from other units in the last 4 weeks. Be warned though that the first half of semester is busy.</p><p>For "Any time Contact time" please use the Discussion Boards (DB) on LMS. There is a dedicated DB for admin issues and seperate DBs for each stats and eng weeks. This makes it easier to find things and to co-locate similar discussions. Learning to use the Discussion Boards constructively is very helpful in this unit.</p><p>The GENG5507 email is not  for course-content or admin related issues, only for individual personal issues. </p><p><strong>Weekly quizzes:</strong></p><p>In Week 1 there is an optional baseline stats quiz due. This has no marks attached but is intended to allow you to assess your own preparedness for the statistics and probability material and allowing you to fill any gaps before the course gets going. See LMS for details. </p><p>There are no other assessed quizzes due in Week 1. The first assessed quizzes are due in Week 2. </p><p>There are separate STATS and ENG quizzes each week (except in weeks 1 and 12). There are different deadlines for the Stats and Eng quizzes. See LMS for details.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">The Eng quiz is based on the Eng pre-work and must be completed before the Eng workshop. Check LMS for the deadline. The Stats quiz follows on from the Stats lecture and practice classes on that subject. <strong>Two attempt are allowed for each of the weekly quizzes, and the highest of the two marks is recorded in  "My Grades"</strong>. Once you have submitted a quiz you can review your submission by going through "My Grade". Before the due date of the quiz,  review of your submission will give the question and your submitted answer; after the due date of the quiz it will give the question, your answer and the correct answer.  Note that if you don't submit an attempt of a quiz, your will not be able to open or review the quiz after the due date (even for midterm and exam review purposes). This is a function of the design of LMS.</span></p><p><strong>WEEKLY STATS AND ENGINEERING QUIZ SUBMISSIONS</strong>:&nbsp; S<u>ubmission of online quizzes by the due date </u>is the responsibility of the students. Since the Quizzes are not times,&nbsp;there is not automatic submission for the quizzes in this unit . What this means is that YOU MUST <strong><u>SUBMIT </u></strong>THEM PRIOR TO THE DEADLINE YOURSELF. If you fail to do this, it shows up as an error in the LMS gradebook. To correct this error is time-consuming for us. Hence we implemented a policy that says that ONLINE QUIZZES WHICH ARE NOT SUBMITTED BY THE DEADLINE WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED TOWARDS ASSESSMENT; SUCH QUIZZES WILL BE GIVEN A MARK OF ZERO FOR THE PARTICULAR ATTEMPT. This means that even in you have answered a number of questions correctly, but submitted late or not submitted, it will not be marked, and you will receive 0 marks for the attempt. LMS measures time up to 1/100th of a second. Hence even if you are late by 1/100th of a second it will not be marked.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Advice is to submit the quizzes well before the due time.&nbsp;</p><p><u>NOTE: The "Late submission of Assignments" policy is not applicable for online quizzes. </u>This approach to quizzes is part of the design of the unit. You get the opportunity to practice your ability to mitigate the risk that you don’t get any marks for a weekly quiz because you did not complete and submit on time. There are many controls for this risk for example, start early (you have a week to do them), use the discussion boards for technical help and so on. Whether you action these controls is up to you. We have told you explicitly here that the consequence of failing to manage the risk is that you will get zero marks for a quiz attempt.<br></p><p><strong>Special consideration for weekly quizzes:</strong></p><p>The only special considerations allowed for the weekly engineering and statistics quizzes are when the student has evidence that they have been unable to attempt the quizzes for all of the 4 days (96 hours) prior to the quiz submission date.</p><p>As mentioned above the reason for this is that this is a unit about risk management. The student is given 14 days to do the quiz. If they leave it to the last minute and are then unable to complete, then that is a risk outcome they have realised. The risk control is to do the quiz early in the 14 day period.</p><p>If students present evidence that they were unavailable for all 4 days (96 hours) and are granted a special consideration, then the pro-rated missed quiz questions total will be added to their end of term exam denominator. This increases the proportion of their final grade dependent on the final exam. Note that missing one weekly quiz is worth ~1.5% of the total grade.</p><p>Note that if a quiz is not opened and attempted it cannot be opened later in LMS for revision and other purposes. This is a function of the design of LMS.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Mid term test:</strong></p><p>The mid term test is done in W7 in place of the W7 workshop (the workshop is available instead as a recording). The mid term is done online for everyone.  The overall value of the test is 15% of the overall marks for this unit. Details are in a folder in LMS and made available a few weeks before the date. Anyone who is granted special consideration for the mid term test will have 15% added to their final exam mark&nbsp;(for such students the final exam will be worth 70%).</p><p>Note that if the mid term test is not opened and attempted it cannot be opened later in LMS for revision and other purposes. This is a function of the design of LMS.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Engineering Workshop quizzes:</strong><br></p><p>Finally please do not confuse the assessed weekly engineering quiz (generally 10 MCQ questions) submitted prior to each workshop with the unassessed Eng workshop quiz (usually 1-2 questions and done during the Eng workshop).</p><p>The unit coordinators encourage those on Sports Scholarships with travel obligations to make contact early in the semester to pro-actively organise assessment deadlines.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>To be successful in this unit requires a level of project management (to engage with the pre work and weekly assessed quizzes) and a willingness to participate in peer-peer activities in the workshops and on the discussion boards. There are separate discussion boards for statistics and engineering questions and these are organised on a week by week basis. </p><p>The Statistics content is taught using lectures and practical classes. Attendance at practice classes is strongly recommended as many of the concepts taught need to be practiced and there are facilitators there to assist you.</p><p>The Engineering theme is taught in a flipped learning mode. Weekly Engineering workshop (2-3hrs) is the face to face classroom activity for Engineering topics. Recorded lectures and other supporting material is provided in LMS. The engineering theme requires you to access and absorb content prior to coming to the Engineering workshop. In the Engineering workshop we will do case studies and other interactive and group activities to allow you to use the content you have read. In practice what this means is that early in the week you need to watch the lectures in the pre-work section of LMS, do the Engineering weekly quiz to test you have understood the lectures, and then prepare for the Engineering workshop. </p><p>The flipped learning approach for the Engineering workshops requires a high level of preparation and planning from the students. Data collected from previous semesters shows that participation in the pre workshop activities, quizzes and discussion boards is closely related to performance in the unit. A published study conducted in GENG5507 in Semester 2 2013 showed a strong relationship between participation and performance. Further statistics obtained in 2016 also showed this pattern. Historically, the median mark in the final exam (worth 65%) for students who attended 4 or less Engineering workshops was 40%. You can mimic the participation experienced in class by discussing your answers to the questions raised in the workshop with your peers and through the discussion boards.</p><p>Please be aware that due to the interactive nature of the Engineering workshop that, although it is recorded, it does not record well on the LCS as much of the talking is done by students rather than the academic with the microphone. We do our best to support students who are not able to make the face to face workshops through the discussion boards.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
