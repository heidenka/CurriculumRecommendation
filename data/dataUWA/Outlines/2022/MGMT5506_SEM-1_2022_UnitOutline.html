                        <p><p>The comments below represent a set of contingency plans for any unforeseen events arising that could impact on this unit in Semester 1, 2022. They supplement all other instructions and conditions regarding the unit contained in the unit outline.</p><p>In the event of a lock down</p><p>For Semester 1, 2022, Ethics and Sustainability Management MGMT5506 is being delivered both Face2Face (F2F) and online on a set date/time. Accordingly, in the event that we need to change in response to COVID-19, the following will apply:</p><p>Delivery difficulties (Unit coordinator)</p><p>If for any reason I am unable to deliver a class and/or we all have to move to online learning, I will send an Announcement to everyone as soon as possible via LMS advising you of the alternative arrangements. In any case, please make sure that you do the assigned pre-reading and watch the assigned videos ahead of each subsequent session.</p><p>Attendance difficulties (Students enrolled in F2F mode)</p><p>If you are enrolled in F2F mode and you are unable to attend a class, please send me an email letting me know why, and then please attend the class online. In any case, please make sure that you do the assigned pre-reading and watch the assigned videos ahead of each subsequent session.</p><p>If you are unable to attend because you are too sick to do so, please let me know ASAP by email and we will explore various contingencies as required for you at the time.</p><p>Attendance difficulties (Students enrolled in Online mode)</p><p>If you are enrolled in the online mode, and you are unable to attend a class because you are too sick to do so, please let me know ASAP by email and we will explore various implications as they apply to you at the time.</p><p>Assignment team meetings</p><p>If you generally come on-campus to meet your team for group assignment work, and there is a campus lock down, you will need to move to alternative arrangments i.e., your Plan B. Accordingly, once you are in a team, in your first meeting together, please make a plan for how you will communicate with each other and share your work in the event of a lock down and/or the need for change. At the very least of course, make sure that you exchange full contact details.</p><p>If you are located remotely i.e., interstate or overseas, there should be minimal disruption for you and you will be able to continue to meet online as planned by you.</p><p>Concluding notes</p><p>Organisations and individuals like yourselves have become somewhat expert in the last couple of years at adapting to change. The way you positively respond to change represents a significant personal competence of interest to prospective employers in the future.</p><p>So, my recommendation is: If you encounter any issues, write down in a document what they were, what you did to overcome them, what the result was and anything else of note about the experience. Save this document for later reference.</p><p>As always, I am only an email away. My goal is to make sure that your learning experience with me is a positive one. If you do encounter any issues, simply send me an email and we'll see what we can do together to address them.</p><p>Dave</p><p>Unit Coordinator</p><p>Associate Professor Dave Webb</p><p>9 February 2022</p></p>

Increasingly, effective leaders and organisations understand that ethics and sustainability management are an integral component of sound business and organisational functioning.

This unit is based on the belief that managers at all levels require specific knowledge, skills and abilities to identify and effectively respond to ethical challenges. The focus is on equipping students to make better decisions, as individuals and as practising managers. Regardless of setting, participants in the unit are well positioned to appropriately serve both the goals of organisations and the needs of society and the environment both in the short and long run, giving all consideration to the ethical challenges in question.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Welcome to the Ethics and Sustainability Management unit. All business operations affect people and the social and natural environments in which people live. Consequently, all management activities have an ethical dimension. Management education must therefore equip students with the opportunity to gain knowledge and experience of the relevance of ethics for their work and their profession. Businesses and organisations are powerful players in contemporary society and their actions have global reach and are the single greatest influence on the Earth's natural and social systems. All organisational members, particularly managers and other professional staff, need to understand and act on their ethical responsibilities. </p><p>This unit equips students with the skills to reflect on and develop their own ethical thinking. Moreover, rapid change means that we constantly face new and emerging ethical issues and topics. We need strong ethical thinking and a clear understanding of our own reflective ethical positions to be able to identify, evaluate, explain, and act on our ethical positions in the face of new ethical challenges. </p><p>Ethics is about advancing the well-being of individuals, groups and communities and this is often a complex and difficult task but it is also an exciting challenge that can unleash potentials for leadership, innovation and taking hold of new opportunities. Ethics and the voicing of values can serve not only to help us navigate through the complex maze of organisational life effectively, but can also be the source for innovation and entrepreneurial dynamism.</p><p><strong>Unit Content</strong></p><p>The content of this unit is based on the recognition that understanding our ethical natures and responsibilities is central to being a good business person and employee. However, understanding by itself is not sufficient to build ethical leadership or ethical organisations. Action is also required. Translating ethical knowledge into practice requires opportunities for applying our understanding in a supportive learning environment and, more importantly, to learn how to skillfully express personal values in the workplace. </p><p>Individuals bring with them a sense of what they believe to be right what becomes more challenging in an organisational context is the ability to give voice to these beliefs. For this reason, a significant component of the unit will focus on enabling students to give voice to their personal and professional values. In other words, a special focus for this unit is placed on action and not just awareness and analysis. To facilitate this student learning you will be supported through the adoption of a variety of teaching tools, techniques and delivery methods. A high level of student participation in discussion, reflection and critical analysis is expected. This unit responds to a growing demand for ethics education to address the practical component of engaging in values-based conversations.</p><p>Examples of key concepts covered in this unit include among others: Ethics, Ethical reasoning, Reflection, Giving Voice to Values, Sustainability, Restorative and Regenerative business, Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's), Life Cycle Analysis and Supply chain issues, Waste Management and Closed Loop Systems.<br></p><p><strong>Unit Goals</strong></p><p>The goals of this unit are to: i) develop students' understanding of the responsibilities of businesses, governments and organisations in contemporary society and ii) to improve students capacity to think and act effectively when dealing with ethical conflicts and/or opportunities. These goals are directly tied to the following educational principles, graduate attributes and assessment mechanisms.</p><p><strong>Unit Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) and the United Nations Global Compact.</strong></p><p>This unit is designed cognisant of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Management Education (UN PRME) to which UWA Business School has been an Advanced Signatory since 2013. UN PRME's ( <a href='http://www.unprme.org/index.php' target='_blank' >http://www.unprme.org/index.php</a> ) Vision is to realise the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) through responsible management education.</p><p>UWA has also been a participant of the United Nations Global Compact (<a href='https://www.unglobalcompact.org/' target='_blank' >https://www.unglobalcompact.org/</a> ) since August 2016. Consequently, the 10 UN Principles form an important inherent part of this unit.</p></p></pre></p>

This should be viewed as healthy learning. By participating in this unit, students will have the opportunity to engage with many educational modalities which may include, among others:</p><p>- Team Based Learning</p><p>- Giving Voice To Values curriculum and case studies</p><p>- Debate and oral presentation work</p><p>- Reflective learning</p><p>- Report writing</p><p>In this unit, you will be encouraged and facilitated to develop the ability and desire to:</p><p>- fully participate in all learning aspects of the unit<br></p><p>- gain an understanding of the big picture on organisational sustainability</p><p>- engage critically with a range of academic and non-academic sources and literature</p><p>- effectively voice ethical concerns and enact values-based responses</p><p>- adapt acquired knowledge to new situations</p><p>- communicate in English effectively, clearly, and logically</p><p>- be able to identify, analyse and take action to address ethical dilemmas and opportunities</p><p>- question accepted wisdom and be open to new ideas and possibilities</p><p>- work independently and in groups; and</p><p>- acquire cross-cultural and other competencies to take a citizenship and leadership role in the local, national or international community.</p><p><strong>Structure</strong><br></p><p>Through the review of video recorded material which you must watch prior to each session, attendance either F2F or online (restricted) in interactive learning workshops delivered via Microsoft Teams, coaching and self directed learning, students are introduced to contemporary issues in ethics and sustainability management. Students will need to draw on their previous learning in the areas of management and business to reinforce and deepen their understanding of associated topics.</p><p><strong>Online and Offline Students</strong></p><p>Participation is a significant part of this unit for all students and as such participation comprises 20% of the assessment. See Assessment 1 for specific details. If you are enrolled as an online (restricted) student, as you are not in the classroom with us in person, you will need to have the use of a camera - be visible on the screen - when you are contributing in the workshop sessions. Ideally you will have your camera on throughout each workshop.<br></p><div><strong>Teaching and Learning Evaluation <br></strong></div><div><p>You may be asked to complete two evaluations during this unit: The Student Perception of Teaching (SPOT) and the Students Unit Reflective Feedback (SURF). The SPOT is optional and is an evaluation of the lecturer and the unit. The SURF is completed online and is a university wide survey and deals only with the unit. You will receive an email inviting you to complete the SURF when it is activated. We encourage you to complete the forms as your feedback is extremely important and can be used to make changes to the unit or lecturing style when appropriate.</p></div></p></pre></p>

Accordingly, the participation of all students is assessed in a number of ways. Please see Assessment 1 (all parts) for detailed information. Please also watch the pre-recorded Participatory Learning video which can be found in the Assessments folder.</p><p>Participation in class - whether you are actively listening to others, speaking yourself, and/or getting involved in other activities - is an important part of the learning process, therefore it is important that you attend (and participate in) classes. <br></p><p>More formally, the University regulations state that to complete a course or unit students shall attend prescribed classes, lectures, seminars and tutorials. Where a student, due to exceptional circumstances, is unable to attend a scheduled class, they are required to obtain prior approval of the unit coordinator to be absent from that class. Any student absent from class without having had such absence approved by the unit coordinator may be referred to the faculty for advice and may be required to withdraw from the unit.</p><p>In our workshops together, you will be called upon to discuss various real and hypothetical relevant cases and issues. Ethics is fundamentally done in community with others. Consequently, it is integral to developing moral discourse and understanding that you are actively involved in class discussions. The purpose of these discussions is to enable you to revise and contextualise the ethical principles you have been learning, and enable you to develop and practice the analytical and thinking skills required to solve ethical and sustainability problems. While attendance is a pre-requisite for this unit, you are also required to participate in full.<br></p><p><strong>Participation Guidelines</strong></p><p>All students are expected to prepare for this unit by watching the pre-recorded videos and completing the weekly readings ahead of each interactive workshop session. When we come together in these interactive workshops, whether you are present in person or participating online, your contribution is expected.&nbsp; <br></p><p><i>If you are enrolled online, you are required to have your camera on when you are communicating with the class. Please make sure that your camera set up is fully functional.</i><br></p><p>Your attendance and participation are key to you maximising your learning experience and enjoying each session. Excellent participation would involve:</p><p>- demonstrates that they are well prepared for lectures;</p><p>- shows respect for the teacher and other students;</p><p>- demonstrates active listening techniques by listening to other students and the teacher in a responsive way and responds appropriately to comments made by others;</p><p>- understands the issues and principles raised in lecture and workshop sessions;</p><p>- and participates constructively in discussions by:</p><p>- answering questions if asked;</p><p>- volunteering a comment, question or answer in a way that is timely and develops the discussion;</p><p>- and not dominating the discussion or using offensive or aggressive language.</p><p>In this regard, it is the quality rather than the quantity of each student's class participation that is most important.</p><br><p><strong>Recording</strong></p><p>All workshop sessions are highly interactive with multiple people talking, potentially simultaneously.

The Harvard style is the preferred used unless otherwise stated by the unit coordinator. There are some notes for guidance which have been prepared by the library staff: 'Citing your Sources Harvard Style' (<a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/harvard' target='_blank' >http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/harvard</a>). The EndNote software package is a really good system for building up a database of references. Not everyone will want to invest the time in using this system but you should consider it if you intend to build up resource materials or plan to undertake extensive research in a particular area. The library staff have also developed a tutoring package: A Quick Guide to Using EndNote which provides the basics for using EndNote with an essay <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnoteAcknowledging' target='_blank' >http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnoteAcknowledging</a> Sources of Information and the Business School Policy on PlagiarismStudent Services provides an online plagiarism portal that includes a definition of plagiarism and a link to FAQ www.studentservices.uwa.edu.au/ss/learning/online_services/plagiarism_portalTurnitin' Originality Checking and Plagiarism Prevention is used in the Faculty to allow both educators and their students check written work for improper citation or misappropriated content.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
