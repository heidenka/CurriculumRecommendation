                        <p><p><b>COVID-19 Guidelines</b></p><p>As you may have already experienced in your undergraduate courses, we continue to face challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing uncertainty it brings. However, as a Department, we continue to plan as best we can to avoid any disruptions, ensure your safety, and protect your learning journey from any negative impact. Although the UWA Optometry course is a professional degree and face-to-face learning cannot be replaced by virtual classes, we have reluctantly made the difficult decision that we will deliver online classes if and when the disruptions occur. Further information and guidance will be shared when needed to make sure you continue to progress in your study. In the meantime, please follow UWA and Western Australia Government's guidelines regarding COVID-19 to help control the spread and impact of the virus. Please read the emails which are regularly sent by the Vice-Chancellor.</p><p>Each Unit has an online classroom link on LMS which can be accessed in the event you are isolating at home.</p></p>

Students are expected to demonstrate the ability to analyse and apply evidence-based solutions in managing disorders of the eye, and by effectively communicating the appropriate management plans.

Topics to be addressed in this unit include:

- understanding ocular manifestations related to the underlying pathological, immunological and microbiological processes associated with systemic, genetic and neurological diseases;

- understanding multi-disciplinary management strategies related to the underlying pathological, immunological and microbiological processes associated with systemic, genetic and neurological diseases;

- developing the knowledge for evidence-based solutions in managing disorders of the eye, including engagement with fellow peers and patients through effective communication of the appropriate management plans;

- developing the skills to perform a complete eye examination for common optometric conditions;

- developing the skills to perform ophthalmic procedures of high complexities.</td>

Students are expected to demonstrate the ability to analyse and apply evidence-based solutions in managing disorders of the eye, and by effectively communicating the appropriate management plans. Topics to be addressed in this unit include: </p><p>- understanding ocular manifestations related to the underlying pathological, immunological and microbiological processes associated with systemic, genetic and neurological diseases;</p><p> - understanding multi-disciplinary management strategies related to the underlying pathological, immunological and microbiological processes associated with systemic, genetic and neurological diseases;</p><p> - developing the knowledge for evidence-based solutions in managing disorders of the eye, including engagement with fellow peers and patients through effective communication of the appropriate management plans;</p><p> - developing the skills to perform a complete eye examination for common optometric conditions; - developing the skills to perform ophthalmic procedures of high complexities</p><p>Learning Outcomes</p><p>At the time of successful completion of the unit, the student should be able to:</p><p>1.	Analyse ocular manifestations related to the underlying pathological, immunological and microbiological processes associated with systemic, genetic and neurological diseases; </p><p>2.	Generate multi-disciplinary management strategies related to the underlying pathological, immunological and microbiological processes associated with systemic, genetic and neurological diseases; </p><p>3.	Judge the risks and benefits of ophthalmic drug treatments to the ocular and systemic outcomes; </p><p>4.	Analyse evidence-based solutions in managing disorders of the eye, including effective communication of the management plans; </p><p>5.	Perform a complete eye examination for common optometric conditions;</p><p>6.	Perform clinical procedures of high complexities e.g. lacrimal lavage, scleral contact lens fitting.</p></p></pre></p>

They will continue to apply other competencies defined by the Optometry Council of Australia and New Zealand (OCANZ) including diagnosis, patient management, recording of clinical data and practical application of ophthalmic dispensing principles. They will further explore legal and ethical issues drawn from the problem-based learning cases and gain clinical knowledge and skills in professional practice associated with the cases through clinical skills seminars. In addition, students will consider in more depth public and population health implications in identifying and managing the conditions presented in the cases. Clinical skills seminars will develop skills based on the cases including developmental and refractive disorders of vision, ocular pathology, and systemic disorders of vision. Transition to clinical practice workshops will prepare students for clinical residential placement and highlight topical issues in optometric practice. Finally, students will be introduced to research methodology in preparation for an extended clinical research project, which will be commenced in later units.</p><p>Students will, on average, spend 300 hours a semester undertaking the teaching, learning and assessment activities associated with this unit. This includes:</p><p>•	8 hours of pre-recorded lectures each week.</p><p>•	11 x 2-hour TBL classes consolidating and integrating learning from biomedical sciences with learning from foundation of Optometry, PBLs and clinical decision-making assessments undertaken in class.</p><p>•	11 x 4-hour PBL cases.</p><p>•	Weekly Clinical Skills sessions. </p><p>•	Around 5 hours of other clinical skills assessments.</p><p>•	Students are expected to dedicate a further 12 hours a week to private study of subject matter contained in this unit, including weekly readings, private revision and completing take-home assignments and assessments.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
                    <p>If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend</li>
                        <li>serious injury</li>
                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The full policy and information on applying for special consideration is available at <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">in the UWA Policy Library </a></p>
                    <h4>Review and Appeal of Academic Decisions Relating to Students</h4>
