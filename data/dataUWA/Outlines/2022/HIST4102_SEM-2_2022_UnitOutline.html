This unit consists of modules which are linked by a common historical theme, rather than by region or time period. It is taught by one or more academic staﬀ from the discipline of History with expertise in European, Australian, Asian, American or African history, and requires students to analyse relevant primary and secondary texts and to research and write an original essay related to the themes of the unit.</p><p>Outcomes</p><p>Students are able to (1) develop a critical understanding of important themes and topics in the study of history and historiography; (2) develop an understanding of diﬀering concepts of and approaches to a particular historical theme or subject; and (3) improve comprehension of these diﬀering concepts and approaches, and to augment their original research skills in the field of history.</p></p></pre></p>

This Honours unit comprises ten two-hour seminars.&nbsp;Topics covered during the semester will be broadly chronological. Over the first half of the unit we consider the nature of slavery and the history of Britain’s slave-worked colonies. We examine the perspectives of the enslaved, and visual representations of slavery in the context of abolitionist debates. We explore the debate sparked by Eric Williams’ classic Capitalism and Slavery (first published in 1944), in which he argued that Britain ended slavery only when its profits declined. Over the second half of the unit we turn to the global impact of abolition after 1833, including in Britain, South Africa and Australia.</p></p></pre></p>

As you pursue your reading, you will notice that most books and articles by professional historians contain numerous references. Your essays for us will have to demonstrate the same technique. We have prepared this Guide to aid you in the use and presentation of source material.</p><p>Please note that the Harvard system (in-text referencing; author/date) is not an acceptable referencing style for History essays.</p><p>Part I: How and when to cite your sources.</p><p>Please begin by reading the following ‘mini-essay’ and studying its footnotes and bibliography.</p><p>The question of the social foundations of socialism has generated historical debate since at least the beginning of the twentieth century, when socialism itself became the most dynamic ideological force in Europe. During recent years, this debate has evoked increasing interest in the role of peasants and artisans in the development of nineteenth-century socialist politics, particularly during the rise of socialism in France.1 Indeed, it has been asserted that ‘the first great wave of socialist militancy depended upon farmers and self-employed skilled workers.’2 Certainly the socialist movement in southern France in the 1890s appears to have evolved from the peasantry, who provided at least sixty percent of its electoral support.3 Unfortunately, many of the most important aspects of this phenomenon remain unexplored.4 The evidence, however, contradicts Marx’s assertion that ‘the proletariat alone is the really revolutionary class.’5</p><p>Notes</p><p>1 See, for instance, Christopher H. Johnson, “Communism and the Working Class Before Marx: The Icarian Experience,” American Historical Review 76, no. 3 (June 1971): 642-689, <a href='https://doi.org/' target='_blank' >https://doi.org/</a> 10.2307/1851621; and William H.

New York: Holmes &amp; Meier Publishers, 1979.</p><p>There are five footnotes for a single paragraph in this example, which has been rather artificially constructed for illustrative purposes. This density of referencing may occasionally be appropriate in your essays, but would normally be too much of a good thing. It would be a rare paragraph of an essay, however, which would not require at least one citation of a source.</p><p>It is best to use the automatic footnote facility to create footnotes (ask your tutor if you don’t know how to use it), though they can also be created manually. Reference numbers should be superscript (as in the example above), and it is usually best to place them at the end of the relevant sentence or paragraph. The notes to which the numbers refer may be placed at the bottom of the page (footnotes) or at the end of the essay (endnotes). We prefer footnotes, but you will not be penalised for using endnotes instead. Number your notes consecutively (notes 1 to 43 throughout your essay, not notes 1 to 3 on p. 1, 1 to 5 on p. 2, 1 to 4 on p. 3 and so on). Historians usually use notes rather than in-text referencing styles (such as Harvard), because they allow for the inclusion of more detail, which is particularly useful when citing unpublished sources such as archival documents.</p><p>You should notice that the first sentence of the ‘mini-essay’ does not have a reference. Generally accepted factual material does not require a citation to support it: we don’t need a source to reassure us that Hitler is a controversial figure or that World War I broke out in 1914.</p><p>Note 1 in the example above is a ‘bibliographical note’ referring to a body of literature. A statement such as ‘there has been an increasing amount of interest’ or ‘some historians have suggested’ would normally require such a reference. This note and the next also illustrate formats for references to the three major varieties of sources: a book (Moss), a journal article (Johnson), and a contribution to an edited collection (Sewell). When citing a contribution to an edited collection, you must always cite both the contribution itself (in this case William H. Sewell, “Property, Labor and the Emergence of Socialism in France”) and the collection in which it appeared (here Consciousness and Class Experience in Nineteenth-Century Europe, ed. John Merriman (New York: Holmes &amp; Meier Publishers, 1979)). You will also see that where you wish to cite more than one source in a footnote, you should separate them with semi-colons.</p><p>Quotations must always have a reference, as in note 2. Where you are referencing a quotation or specific idea, you must give the page number/s on which this quote or idea appears (rather than the entire page range for the article or chapter). Note 3 shows you how to refer to a work which has already been referred to in a preceding note. You must give the author’s last name and shortened version of the title, as well as the necessary page reference, but should not mention any other bibliographical information. In the past it was common to use the Latin terms op.cit. or ibid. (so that the reference would have read: Moss, ibid., 47.), but these Latinisms are falling out of favour, and you should use the short title format instead. Statistics must always be referenced, as with note 3.</p><p>Not all notes include a citation. Some may develop a point which is worth mentioning, but which is too peripheral to be included in the body of the essay, as with note 4. You can overuse this form, since there is a narrow range between including material in such a note which would best be omitted altogether or, alternatively, should have been included in the body of the essay.</p><p>Note 5 shows how you should cite material which was itself cited in one of your sources. It would be unacceptable in this case to simply cite Johnson, and it would be dishonest to simply cite the Manifesto, since you had not consulted this source in the original. You will notice that this reference to Johnson is another short title citation, since this source was used in note 1.</p><p>Finally, every history essay must include a bibliography listing all the sources used. These must be alphabetised by author’s surname. Note that although the bibliographical information included is the same as for the first citation of a work in the notes, the format of bibliographical entries is quite different from that of the notes. It is important to follow the conventions for both notes and bibliography precisely. Note that in your bibliography, you must provide the full page range for journal articles and chapters in edited books.</p><p>The above examples of referencing do not exhaust the problems that arise in citing sources and compiling bibliographies. Please consult your tutor if you have any questions.</p><p>Part 2: A guide to citation style</p><p>During your time at university, you should become familiar with a range of different citation styles. In our history units, we ask you to use Chicago style, which is widely used in published works, and relatively straightforward.</p><p>Examples of how to cite a book, a journal article, and a contribution to an edited collection appear above. You should note carefully the order in which information about the book appears, and the use of commas, full stops, quotation marks, parentheses and italics.</p><p>A full guide to citing a wide range of materials using Chicago style is available on the UWA library website at <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/Chicago_citation' target='_blank' >http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/Chicago_citation</a></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>

                        <li>serious injury</li>
                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The full policy and information on applying for special consideration is available at <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">in the UWA Policy Library </a></p>
