                        <p><p><b>TEACHING ARRANGEMENTS</b></p><p>UWA Law School continues to value and prioritise face-to-face learning. However, due to the ever-evolving pandemic, protecting our student body and minimising the disruption to student learning, the student experience, and your academic progression is our priority. In light of this, after having considered a range of options, students have been given the option to attend face-to-face OR online tutorials for the duration of this semester.</p><p>Students who elect a face-to-face tutorial but are required to isolate for a period pursuant to Government guidelines, must contact the Unit Coordinator to be allocated to an online tutorial for the duration of their isolation.</p><p>In the event of future COVID-19 restrictions preventing face-to-face classes, all lectures and tutorials will be delivered online for the relevant period.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>COVID PROTOCOLS</b></p><p>The Law School has developed protocols to deal with those instances where a student has been in a lecture or tutorial and, following the class, is required to isolate and undergo a COVID test under Government guidelines.</p><p>1. The student is expected to inform their Unit Coordinator/tutor/lecturer that they are undergoing a COVID test for any reason - they are symptomatic, are a close contact, were at an exposure site, etc.</p><p>2. All other students/staff that were present in that class will be informed of this fact, ensuring the student's/ identity and circumstances are kept confidential.</p><p>3. Under current Government guidelines the other students/staff are not required to isolate or be tested but they may wish to do so.</p><p>4. The student is expected to inform their Unit Coordinator/tutor/lecturer of the outcome of the test who will in turn inform others in the class.</p><p>5. If the student tests positive, all members of the class must follow government guidelines regarding testing and isolation.</p><p><b>And in relation to tutorials:</b></p><p>Students who are allocated to a face-to-face tutorial but are required to isolate for a period pursuant to Government guidelines, must contact the Unit Coordinator to be allocated to an online tutorial for the duration of their isolation.</p><p>To facilitate the assessment of tutorial participation in online tutorials, students attending online tutorials should enable their cameras. </p></p>

It includes consideration of: mineral and petroleum ownership, land open for mining, theories of crown disposition, administration of mining dispositions, applications including marking out priorities, exploration tenements, production tenements, surrender and forfeiture, exemptions, questions of law, judicial review and appeals, commercial arrangements, oil and gas licences, development approvals, state agreements, registration and dealings. The key aims of the unit include the consideration and analysis of differing regimes of disposition of publicly owned resources; an understanding of the advantages and disadvantages, and benefits and costs of differing regimes of disposition; an understanding of the relationship of differing regimes of disposition to social and economic considerations, and fundamental principles of commercial and property law; and an understanding of the essential incidental elements of a regime of disposition of resources, including security in title and transactions. In its examination and analysis of Mining Law and Oil and Gas Law in Western Australia this unit also focuses on the practical application of that law in relation to matters like the obtaining of a mining or petroleum tenement. There is an increasing focus in the industry on sustainability and climate change and these will be discussed in the context of the future of minerals extraction.</p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Mining and Energy Law builds on the legal principles you would have studied in earlier units. The unit traverses a range of different resource industries, transactions and practice areas. As a consequence of the breadth of coverage, one of the overarching challenges within this subject is to avoid an overly superficial understanding of the law and its practical relevance. To this end, the subject is delivered in a manner that seeks to build a conceptual framework for the subject as a whole, to anchor this framework to real life issues and to actively engage students in legal research and reasoning processes - in a similar fashion to the way you would in the real world. Assessment has been designed with these purposes in mind.<br></p></p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Unit Structure</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit will consist of 12 x 1 hour and 45 minute lectures.  Lectures will be held each week on Thursdays from 9am pm to 11 am in the Ross Lecture Theatre.  The lectures in this unit will be recorded in case you are unable to attend class in exceptional circumstances. However, this unit is offered in face-to-face mode and listening to recordings should not be viewed as a substitute for attending class.  Moreover, as many of the lectures will involve a practical workshop component, which may not be adequately captured by lecture recording facilities, you are strongly encouraged to attend all lectures in person. Students should be aware that lecture recordings may fail from time to time for technical or other reasons. Where this occurs it may not be possible to rectify the problem and the class will not be repeated or re-recorded.</p><p>There will be 4 x 1 hour and 45 minute tutorials.  Tutorials will be held on the weeks outlined in the teaching schedule below. Please ensure you have enrolled in a tutorial in the class allocation system at www.cas.uwa.edu.au. The class allocation system allows you to select your preferred class time. The class allocation system will then assign you to a class based on your preferences. You may be given an opportunity to change your tutorial time in the class allocation system if an alternative time is available. Unfortunately, the unit coordinator is not able to handle requests from students to be allocated to a specific tutorial or to move students to a different class once assigned in the class allocation system as unit coordinators do not have access to the class allocation system. If you have a question or difficulties with your tutorial enrolment, please contact the Student Office through AskUWA (www.ask.uwa.edu.au) and they should be able to assist you.</p><p>The JD curriculum has been purposefully designed to scaffold sequential knowledge and skills progression, and may be completed in three years full-time or on a part-time basis. Those who undertake external work, travel or sporting commitments are expected to plan these around their studies. Except in exceptional circumstances, these commitments are not accepted as grounds for a variation in the prescribed sequence of units, or as valid reasons for timetable changes,* swapping tutorials, the waiving of pre-requisites or variation from the prescribed course structure.* In making a decision as to whether to complete the JD on a full or part-time basis, students must be aware that the estimated time commitment for a standard full-time enrolment is approximately 40 hours per week (over each 12 week semester), excluding examinations. Each unit, including intensive units in non-standard teaching periods, requires an overall time commitment of 150 hours.</p><p>* Students accepted into the UWA Elite Athletes Program, or who undertake exchange or other commitments which involve official representation of the Law School or the University, may seek approval from the Deputy Head of School (Students) for a variation in the prescribed course structure.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
