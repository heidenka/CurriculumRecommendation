                        <p><p>This unit includes theoretical and practical knowledge as well a significant skill development. While much of the underpinning knowledge may be accessed asynchronously through the LMS, a significant face-to-face component (i.e. tutorials, case studies and laboratory practical classes) is required for development of critical thinking, problem solving and practical laboratory skill development required by professional accreditation standards.</p><p>Students are expected to attend face to face classes when they are scheduled. Adherence to state and university directions relating to mask use, proof of vaccination, social distancing and all other safety measures are required to attend campus.</p><p>To support student theoretical learning during asynchronous delivery, the unit coordinator is available for consultation weekly during the office hours listed above.</p><p>In the event of widespread restrictions to campus access or limitations on venue capacity, some face-to-face classes may be converted to synchronous but online activities. However, activities that require interaction of students with laboratory equipment, specialist staff, laboratory reagents or samples, including but not limited to practical competency assessments, cannot be converted to an online activity. Efforts will be made to complete these classes on time with increased protections and / or reduced room occupancy. Where this is not possible, classes may be deferred until restrictions ease, including potential deferral of classes and / or assessments beyond the semester.</p><p>Accommodations have been made in anticipation of some staff absences due to mandatory isolation and / or illness to allow scheduled practical classes to continue. However, significant unexpected staff absences may disrupt the planned schedule, resulting in deferral of some classes or assessments. Where this occurs students will be notified by email and LMS announcement of both the cancellation and the new schedule as early as possible.</p><p>Laboratory and tutorial classes are not routinely recorded and usually cannot feasibly be repeated or deferred to accommodate individual students. However, students who are unable to attend a required face to face class due to mandatory isolation, illness or other awarded special consideration will be provided class notes and other available resources related to the class and may avail themselves of office hours consultation where further support is needed. Students who miss a scheduled on campus assessment and are awarded special consideration may be offered alternative assessment where feasible, or have their assessment deferred, including deferral beyond the semester.</p></p>

The aim is achieved by increasing knowledge and understanding of; principles of immunohaematology, methods for pre-transfusion testing and selection of compatible blood products for transfusion, the pathophysiology and investigation of transfusion reactions, and awareness of transfusion requirements of pregnant women and neonates.</td>

On completion of the unit students are expected to understand and apply the Australian regulatory framework for pre-transfusion testing and transfusion practice in a clinical laboratory.</p><p>The aim is achieved by increasing knowledge and understanding of; principles of immunohaematology, methods for pre-transfusion testing and selection of compatible blood products for transfusion, the pathophysiology and investigation of transfusion reactions, and awareness of transfusion requirements of pregnant women and neonates.</p></p></pre></p>

While the activities involved have undergone risk assessment and relevant institutional biosafety approvals, some activities are considered to be exposure-prone procedures (EPPs). As such, it is important that students meet the expectations for Health Care Workers in Western Australia. Under these guidelines HCWs and students are responsible for ensuring—(1) they know their own blood borne virus status; (2) their vaccination status against vaccine preventable diseases is current and they can provide evidence of HBV vaccination or documented evidence of non-responder status; (3) any refusal to undertake recommended vaccinations and/or serology is to be documented; and (4) they adopt infection prevention practices to minimise the risk of occupational exposure (e.g. use of appropriate personal protective equipment and safe handling and disposal of sharps).</p><p>To pass this unit, a student must: (a) achieve an overall mark of 50 per cent or higher for the unit; and (b) achieve a mark of 80 per cent or greater for the practical examinations component.</p><p>Supplementary assessment is available by application to the unit coordinator for those students who obtain a mark of at least 50% overall and obtained a mark of less than 80% in one specified component (failed component) of the unit.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
