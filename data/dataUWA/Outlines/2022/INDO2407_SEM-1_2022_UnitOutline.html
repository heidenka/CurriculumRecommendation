It brings students to a sophisticated level of proficiency in both formal and informal Indonesian. It extends students’ speaking, reading and writing skills through exposure to contemporary literature, films, academic Indonesian texts and journalism. Students are introduced to the world of Indonesian literature and independent film making. They read short stories in Indonesian and study a popular Indonesian movie in detail. Students are also expected to achieve a high level of skill in writing through completing an extended academic essay in Indonesian on a contemporary social, cultural or political issue in Indonesia. By doing so, students gain not only a high level of proficiency in reading and writing, but also a detailed knowledge of contemporary problems in Indonesia. Areas covered in the unit include literary, journalistic, academic and colloquial Indonesian including Jakartan slang or ’bahasa gaul’.</td>

It is designed to bring students to a sophisticated level of proficiency in both formal and informal Indonesian. It extends students' speaking, reading and writing skills through exposure to contemporary literature, films, academic Indonesian texts and journalism. </p><p>In this unit students are introduced to the world of Indonesian literature and independent filmmaking. They read short stories in Indonesian and study a popular Indonesian movie in detail. Students are also expected to achieve a high level of skill in writing through completing an extended academic essay in Indonesian on a contemporary social, cultural, or political issue in Indonesia. By doing so, students gain not only a high level of proficiency in reading and writing, but also a detailed knowledge of contemporary problems in Indonesia.</p><p>Areas covered in the unit include literary, journalistic, academic and colloquial Indonesian including Jakartan slang or bahasa gaul.<br></p><p>This unit is designed to enable students to achieve Level 3+ of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (ISLPR) (Elaine Wylie and D. E. Ingram, Griffith University, 2012). </p><p>Students are able to (1) reach a high level of spoken and written Indonesian; (2) demonstrate a knowledge of contemporary literature and film; (3) express opinions with a relatively high degree of nuance; (4) read and write academic Indonesian; (5) analyse a social, cultural or political issue using authentic Indonesian source materials; and (6) demonstrate an awareness of the social and political context of literary and cinematic production.</p><p>On successful completion of this unit students can expect to be able to:</p><p>•	Reach a high level of spoken and written Indonesian</p><p>•	Demonstrate a knowledge of contemporary literature and film</p><p>•	Express opinions with a relatively high degree of nuance</p><p>•	Read and write academic Indonesian</p><p>•	Analyse a social, cultural or political issue using authentic Indonesian source materials </p><p>•	Demonstrate an awareness of the social and political context of literary and cinematic production</p></p></pre></p>

In the Monday classes you will focus on a popular Indonesian film. In the Wednesday classes the focus is on short stories and authentic materials on Indonesian culture and society. An exposure to Indonesian popular media will provide a valuable window into contemporary language use and contemporary youth culture. Because there are only two contact hours a week in this unit, you will be required to do a considerable amount of work on your own. This includes in-depth preparation for class discussions and other assignments. </p><p>You will do a research project using Indonesian language materials, culminating in a 1300 word essay in Indonesian on a contemporary social, cultural or political issue. This will familiarise you with the proliferating popular Indonesian literature and give you experience in using Indonesian source materials. You will be marked not only on the language but also on the quality of the research. Presentations and discussions of your research in class will give you an opportunity to lift your language beyond the level of everyday conversation. Each student will do a 10-15 minute presentation on the topic of their research. This should be presented from notes, not recited verbatim.</p><p>An in-depth look at the popular film Ada Apa Dengan Cinta2? (What’s up with Cinta 2?) will provide a valuable window into contemporary (well, almost…) language use and youth culture. The film will also provide a springboard into several issues and debates that we will explore in class. Watching the film while doing exercises based on the Ada Apa Dengan Cinta 2 Exercises offers a valuable opportunity to scrutinise particular exchanges in detail.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

Tuesday, class 1: Popular Language Use </p><p>This class is designed to extend your spoken Indonesian into new, specialised areas. The main activity in this class will be watching and discussing in detail a popular Indonesian film. You will also be provided with exercise and reading materials that relate to language used and issues raised in the films, together with some questions to consider for class discussion. You will have ample opportunity to practise your oral skills and be introduced to a range of new vocabularies and styles, especially relating to urban youth language. Group activities include skits, debates and discussions designed to develop confidence and competence. For the skits, you will be required to memorize dialogues/monologues from the movie/readings and perform it in class. </p><p>This class will also be the forum for the discussion of your major semester project. Beginning in Week 11, you will be required to present 10-15 minute talks on the subject of your research.</p><p>2. Thursday, class 2: Popular Literature &amp; Contemporary Society</p><p>For this class you will read a variety of Indonesian literature and discuss their content and context. This will expose you to formal/academic Indonesian literature and introduce you to a range of new vocabulary and contemporary styles. Required preparation for these classes is set out in the Study Program. </p><p>For both Monday and Wednesday classes, you will receive a participation mark and be required to complete exercises at home, some of which may be assigned as we go. So check LMS regularly for information on this. The participation mark will be given based on the quality of your participation, not your attendance. It is an opportunity for you to show off how hard you’ve prepared for the class. </p><p>Non-contact or home study consists of the following:</p><p>1. Preparation for class</p><p>It is important that you prepare for class. Look up the words that you don’t know. Take note of words/expressions which you can’t find in the dictionary for discussion in class. Think about the issues raised in your readings. What are your thoughts on it? See ‘Study Program section’ and also, be sure to check Blackboard for further information on weekly exercises. </p><p>For the Popular Language classes, mimic the actors in the film. Practice saying the dialogues out loud. Practice reading out loud and memorize them. Be prepared to perform the dialogues/monologues in class. </p><p>2. Assignments</p><p>The most important assignment for this unit is your Research Project. This involves researching and writing a 1300 word essay in Indonesian, with details below. </p><p>Please note that unless otherwise specified, work submitted for assessment could be submitted in person or electronically via email or the Blackboard website in Word format (i.e. as an attachment) by the specified date (and time!).  Ensure that the document is double spaced and in a font that is easy to read. You must ensure that you keep a copy on your computer. </p><p>3. Additional Study and Practice</p><p>Take every opportunity to practise your Indonesian and to listen to it being spoken! e.g. Participate in an Indonesian discussion group that (I hope!) will be run by students of Indonesian at UWA in conjunction with the Indonesian Student Society in UWA (INDOSS). Chat with Indonesians online. Make Indonesian friends on Facebook. If you are having trouble with some aspect of the language, let your lecturer know. Keep up to date with science and technology, boybands, fashion, fitness or even FHM in Indonesian via <a href='http://www.pressreader.com/catalog/countries/indonesia&nbsp' target='_blank' >http://www.pressreader.com/catalog/countries/indonesia&nbsp</a>;</p></p></pre></p>

Some things you might want to consider are: What are your thoughts on it? What are the themes that most interested you? Why? How is youth culture reflected in the movie? How is Indonesian society or politics reflected in the movie? How was language used? etc. Helpful here will be the publication Ada Apa Dengan Cinta 2? (What’s up with Love 2?)</p><p>You will be required to interview (informally) two Indonesians verbally (and possibly make friends in the process!) and write up notes of your interview and your reflections on it. The conversation must be carried out in Indonesian and should last for at least 20 minutes. Both of your participants (interviewees) have to be Indonesians (native speaker of colloquial Indonesian). At least one of your participants should be a student at UWA. If they are about your age, talk to them in a casual manner as if to your friends using colloquial Indonesian. <br></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
