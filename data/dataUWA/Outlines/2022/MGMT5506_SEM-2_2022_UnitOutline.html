                        <p><p>The comments below represent a set of contingency plans for any unforeseen events arising that could impact on this unit in Semester 2, 2022. They supplement all other instructions and conditions regarding the unit contained in the unit outline.</p><p>In the event of a lock down</p><p>For Semester 2, 2022, Ethics and Sustainability Management MGMT5506 is being delivered both Face2Face (F2F) and online on a set date/time. Accordingly, in the event that we need to change in response to COVID-19, the following will apply:</p><p>Delivery difficulties (Unit coordinator)</p><p>If for any reason I am unable to deliver a class and/or we all have to move to online learning, I will send an Announcement to everyone as soon as possible via LMS advising you of the alternative arrangements. In any case, please make sure that you do the assigned pre-reading and watch the assigned videos ahead of each subsequent session.</p><p>Attendance difficulties (Students enrolled in F2F mode)</p><p>If you are enrolled in F2F mode and you are unable to attend a class, please send me an email letting me know why, and then please attend the class online. In any case, please make sure that you do the assigned pre-reading and watch the assigned videos ahead of each subsequent session.</p><p>If you are unable to attend because you are too sick to do so, please let me know ASAP by email and we will explore various contingencies as required for you at the time.</p><p>Attendance difficulties (Students enrolled in Online mode)</p><p>If you are enrolled in the online mode, and you are unable to attend a class because you are too sick to do so, please let me know ASAP by email and we will explore various implications as they apply to you at the time.</p><p>Assignment team meetings</p><p>If you generally come on-campus to meet your team for group assignment work, and there is a campus lock down, you will need to move to alternative arrangments i.e., your Plan B. Accordingly, once you are in a team, in your first meeting together, please make a plan for how you will communicate with each other and share your work in the event of a lock down and/or the need for change. At the very least of course, make sure that you exchange full contact details.</p><p>If you are located remotely i.e., interstate or overseas, there should be minimal disruption for you and you will be able to continue to meet online as planned by you.</p><p>Concluding notes</p><p>Organisations and individuals like yourselves have become somewhat expert in the last couple of years at adapting to change. The way you positively respond to change represents a significant personal competence of interest to prospective employers in the future.</p><p>So, my recommendation is: If you encounter any issues, write down in a document what they were, what you did to overcome them, what the result was and anything else of note about the experience. Save this document for later reference.</p><p>As always, I am only an email away. My goal is to make sure that your learning experience with me is a positive one. If you do encounter any issues, simply send me an email and we'll see what we can do together to address them.</p></p>

Increasingly, effective leaders and organisations understand that ethics and sustainability management are an integral component of sound business and organisational functioning.

This unit is based on the belief that managers at all levels require specific knowledge, skills and abilities to identify and effectively respond to ethical challenges. The focus is on equipping students to make better decisions, as individuals and as practising managers. Regardless of setting, participants in the unit are well positioned to appropriately serve both the goals of organisations and the needs of society and the environment both in the short and long run, giving all consideration to the ethical challenges in question.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Welcome to the Ethics and Sustainability Management' unit. All business operations affect people and the social and natural environments in which people live. Consequently, all management activities have an ethical dimension. Management education must therefore equip students with the opportunity to gain knowledge and experience of the relevance of ethics for their work and their profession. Businesses and organisations are powerful players in contemporary society and their actions have global reach and are the single greatest influence on the Earth's natural and social systems. All organisational members, particularly managers and other professional staff, need to understand and act on their ethical responsibilities. </p><p>This unit equips students with the skills to reflect on and develop their own ethical thinking. Moreover, rapid change means that we constantly face new and emerging ethical issues and topics. We need strong ethical thinking and a clear understanding of our own reflective ethical positions to be able to identify, evaluate, explain, and act on our ethical positions in the face of new ethical challenges. </p><p>Ethics is about advancing the well-being of individuals, groups and communities and this is often a complex and difficult task but it is also an exciting challenge that can unleash potentials for leadership, innovation and taking hold of new opportunities. Ethics and the voicing of values can serve not only to help us navigate through the complex maze of organisational life effectively, but can also be the source for innovation and entrepreneurial dynamism.</p><p><strong>Unit Content</strong></p><p>The content of this unit is based on the recognition that understanding our ethical natures and responsibilities is central to being a good business person and employee. However, understanding by itself is not sufficient to build ethical leadership or ethical organisations. Action is also required. Translating ethical knowledge into practice requires opportunities for applying our understanding in a supportive learning environment and, more importantly, to learn how to skillfully express personal values in the workplace. </p><p>Individuals bring with them a sense of what they believe to be right what becomes more challenging in an organisational context is the ability to give voice to these beliefs. For this reason, a significant component of the unit will focus on enabling students to give voice to their personal and professional values. In other words, a special focus for this unit is placed on action and not just awareness and analysis. To facilitate this student learning you will be supported through the adoption of a variety of teaching tools, techniques and delivery methods. A high level of student participation in discussion, reflection and critical analysis is expected. This unit responds to a growing demand for ethics education to address the practical component of engaging in values-based conversations.</p><p><strong>Unit Goals</strong></p><p>The goals of this unit are to: i) develop students' understanding of the responsibilities of businesses, governments and organisations in contemporary society and ii) to improve students capacity to think and act effectively when dealing with ethical conflicts and/or opportunities. These goals are directly tied to the following educational principles, graduate attributes and assessment mechanisms.</p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>

This should be viewed as healthy learning. By participating in this unit, students will have the opportunity to engage with many educational modalities which may include, among others:</p><p>- Team Based Learning</p><p>- Giving Voice To Values curriculum and case studies</p><p>- Debate and oral presentation work</p><p>- Reflective learning</p><p>- Report writing</p><p>In this unit, you will be encouraged and facilitated to develop the ability and desire to:</p><p>- gain an understanding of the big picture on organisational sustainability</p><p>- engage critically with a range of academic and non-academic sources and literature</p><p>- effectively voice ethical concerns and enact values-based responses</p><p>- adapt acquired knowledge to new situations</p><p>- communicate in English effectively, clearly, and logically</p><p>- be able to identify, analyse and take action to address ethical dilemmas and opportunities</p><p>- question accepted wisdom and be open to new ideas and possibilities</p><p>- work independently and in groups; and</p><p>- acquire cross-cultural and other competencies to take a citizenship and leadership role in the local, national or international community.</p><p><strong>Team Based Learning</strong></p><p>This course is delivered using aspects of the Team-Based-Learning (TBL) format. Accordingly, you will be assigned to a team with up to 6 members. Teams will be formed in class during the first week. The essence of team-based learning is that you prepare for classes by studying the course readings, becoming familiar with their ideas and content then apply this content in the classroom activities. In-class online quizzes ensure that your learning is assessed in the process. This is called the online Readiness Assurance Test (RAT) because students take on the responsibility to be ready for applying in class what they have learned beforehand.</p><p><strong>Online and Offline Students</strong></p><p>Participation is a significant part of this unit for all students and as such participation comprises 20% of the assessment. See Assessment 1 for specific details. If you are enrolled as an online (restricted) student, as you are not in the classroom with us in person, you will need to have the use of a camera - be visible on the screen - when you are contributing in the workshop sessions. Ideally you will have your camera on throughout each workshop.</p><p><strong>Teaching and Learning Evaluation</strong></p><p>You may be asked to complete two evaluations during this unit: The Student Perception of Teaching (SPOT) and the Students Unit Reflective Feedback (SURF). The SPOT is optional and is an evaluation of the lecturer and the unit. The SURF is completed online and is a university wide survey and deals only with the unit. You will receive an email inviting you to complete the SURF when it is activated. We encourage you to complete the forms as your feedback is extremely important and can be used to make changes to the unit or lecturing style when appropriate.</p></p></pre></p>

More formally, the University regulations state that to complete a course or unit students shall attend prescribed classes, lectures, seminars and tutorials. Where a student, due to exceptional circumstances, is unable to attend a scheduled class, they are required to obtain prior approval of the unit coordinator to be absent from that class. Any student absent from class without having had such absence approved by the unit coordinator may be referred to the faculty for advice and may be required to withdraw from the unit.</p><p>In lectures students will discuss various real and hypothetical ethical cases and questions. Ethics is fundamentally done in community with others. Consequently, it is integral to developing moral discourse and understanding that you are actively involved in class discussions. The purpose of these discussions is to enable students to revise and contextualise the ethical principles they have been learning and to develop and practice the analytical and thinking skills that are required in order to undertake logical and closely argued applications of those principles to the resolution of ethical problems. While attendance at tutorials is a pre-requisite for this unit, you are also required to participate. <br></p><p><strong>Participation Guidelines</strong></p><p>All students are expected to prepare for lectures by completing the Weekly readings and to contribute to class discussions in these sessions. Attendance and participation is the key to enjoyable classes and effective learning. Excellent participation would involve:</p><p>- demonstrates that they are well prepared for lectures;</p><p>- shows respect for the teacher and other students;</p><p>- demonstrates active listening techniques by listening to other students and the teacher in a responsive way and responds appropriately to comments made by others;</p><p>- understands the issues and principles raised in lecture questions;</p><p>- and participates constructively in discussions by:</p><p>     - answering questions if asked;</p><p>     - volunteering a comment, question or answer in a way that is timely and develops the discussion;</p><p>     - and not dominating the discussion or using offensive or aggressive language.</p><p>In this regard, it is the quality rather than the quantity of each student's class participation that is most important.</p><p><strong>Facial visibility and student identification (online students)</strong></p><p>Given the high level of participation sought in this unit, you are asked to make yourself visible (using your camera) throughout each live workshop session, and certainly so when you are speaking with the class. Please check that you have sufficient bandwidth to enable this.</p><p>Further information about privacy can be found at <a href='https://www.web.uwa.edu.au/privacy' target='_blank' >https://www.web.uwa.edu.au/privacy</a></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
