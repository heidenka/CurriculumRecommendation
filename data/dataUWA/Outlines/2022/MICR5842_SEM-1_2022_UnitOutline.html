                                    <td>The objectives of MICR5842 Infection and Immunity are to familiarize students with the molecular and cellular basis of the immune system, to understand how the immune response protects humans from infection with viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms, and the effects of age on immune responses. The interaction between infectious agents and the human host is explored, particularly with regard to the integrity of the host immune  system  and  strategies  used  by  infectious  agents  to  evade  immune responses. 

Students will acquire the capacity to understand how pathogen-specific immune responses contribute to disease in the host, and how immune-based treatment and prevention strategies combat infectious disease. In addition they will learn to analyse published studies which describe investigations of the interaction between pathogen and host immune responses. Practical skills in technologies widely used in immunology laboratories will be acquired in Laboratory classes and eTutorials.

All parts of the unit require compulsory attendance (laboratories, seminars and tutorials), except for the 14 lectures which are delivered in the first 2 weeks of semester 1. However, attendance at the lectures is highly recommended.</td>

In addition to the role of the immune response in health and disease, disease prevention and treatment will be explored, including vaccination and immunotherapies.</p><p>Students will analyse, criticise and discuss published studies to improve their critical thinking skills in the context of infection and immunity: the interaction between pathogen and host cell immune responses; how these responses contribute to disease in the host; and immune-based prevention and treatment approaches and their efficacy in controlling pathogen infection.</p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>

Blended learning (face-to-face and online teaching)</p><p>2. Constructivist (student-centred) teaching with active learning strategies - Students are expected to actively participate in knowledge construction (e.g., seminar presentation assignment and tutorials). Teaching and learning activities will include discussion, information gathering and synthesis, question generation, and reflection.</p><p>3. Experiential learning - Practical laboratory classes will enable students to learn immunology principles and applications through experimentation, problem solving and reflection.</p><p>4. Instructivist (traditional) teaching and learning strategies - Informative and engaging lectures will allow the introduction and discussion of relevant immunology topics.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

Fourteen lectures covering the basic concepts of innate and adaptive immunity, effector cells and cytokines, the structural and molecular basis of antigen recognition and mechanisms of immune control of infectious pathogens will be delivered in the first 3 weeks of semester, and will be followed by an assessment of the lecture content. Then students move onto advanced immunology lectures covering vaccines, immunotherapies, immune dysregulation, heterologous immunity and cancer, which will be delivered later in the semester.</p><p>There will be 3-4 hours of compulsory wet laboratory work per week for six weeks; approximately 1.5 hour of weekly tutorials throughout the semester as scheduled; and 3 seminars, designed for students to give oral presentations of assigned work. A self-contained module on vaccines will be delivered by an invited guest lecturer will be delivered in the second half of semester.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
                    <p>If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:</p>

                        <li>serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend</li>
                        <li>serious injury</li>
                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
