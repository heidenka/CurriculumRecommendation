                        <p><p>My preference is that everyone who can participate face to face (f2f) in this unit does so.&nbsp; This is very helpful for building effective teams, which is important because we work together for 2 semesters.&nbsp; Please consider wearing a mask.&nbsp; I will happily move the class temporarily outside for discussion and mask-free time as appropriate.</p><p>If I am unable to come to campus (for example if I or my children are close contacts or Covid-19 positive), then students are welcome to continue to meet f2f, and I will host an workshop online from my house on Teams.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I, or a UWA delegate, will contact you to notify your of the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;If I'm too unwell to host a workshop, I will cancel class.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;If none of us are able to meet f2f, workshops will be moved 100% to Teams.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;If any individual student is unable to participate in f2f mode, they can join an online workshop.&nbsp; If you are unwell, you may simply skip the workshop.<br></p><p>If you become sick due to Covid-19, your priorities are to get well and not to spread the disease. DO NOT COME TO CLASS. Focus on getting better, not stressing about your design tasks! I appreciate your letting me know about any illness that impacts you.</p><p>Assessments have long lead times and are group project based.  I am going to ask that as much as possible, students consider how they can work flexibly to adapt to individuals becoming ill or having to isolate, to minimise disruption to deliverables.  This is important for the final presentation in October, as we will invite external stakeholders to that presentation.  </p><p>However, it may be that illness or isolation requirements significantly impact the class.  </p><p>In this case (a) the UWA 2-week no-questions-asked deadline extension will apply to any individual assessments, and (b) I will work with the class to renegotiate our expectations and timeline around group assessment as needed.</p></p>

Students work in teams, typically with four to six members, and are supervised by an academic and/or industry mentor. Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project are to lead students through a systematic engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare them for professional practice as engineers.

Students work in teams, typically with four to six members, and are supervised by an academic and/or industry mentor. Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project are to lead students through a systematic engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare them for professional practice as engineers. The focus of this unit is on teamwork skills and the design process.</p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>

These workshops include guest speakers from industry, experts from UWA, and the course coordinator.  In addition to technical and project-specific content, workshops will also focus on teamwork, communication, research and executive skills needed for success in team-based engineering design.  </p><p>The afternoon session will usually be available to you to work on individual and group assessment tasks.  Sally will be available for consultation and feedback during these periods.  I recommend that you plan your week such that Thursday becomes your "design day" and you use this scheduled time to get the work done for this unit.  </p><p>We are trying to organise at least one field trip (hopefully to Scitech) during the unit. Details will be shared once they're available.</p></p></pre></p>

All class members are expected to read a minimum of 2 tenders other than their own, and to offer at least one substantive and constructive piece of feedback for each tender document they read.  You will be assessed based primarily on the quality of your contributed feedback (e.g. substantive comments on ideas, methods and approaches are more valuable than superficial comments on e.g. citation style), secondarily on its tone (comments should be constructive and not hurtful).</p><p>The second component will be a self-reflection on one technical item to which you have contributed during the semester.&nbsp; You will write a 1 page report on the contribution (including an illustrative figure), in the style of a career episode report (as per Engineers Australia's requirements for meeting your Stage 1 Engineering Competencies).&nbsp; This will be due in the second-last week of semester, but can be based on a contribution made earlier in the semester.&nbsp; This item is intended to ensure that everyone makes a substantial contribution to your team's technical work, while giving you practice in writing career episode reports as you are required to do for graduation.&nbsp;</p><p>The third component will be based on how you conduct yourself in the class sessions, including your engagement with visiting experts, participation in group work and class discussions, and any efforts you make to helping the class proceed smoothly and capably.  This component of the grade will be given by the instructor based on their observations of your conduct in class.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>

                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
