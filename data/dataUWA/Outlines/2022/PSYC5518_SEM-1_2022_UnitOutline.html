                        <p><p><b>For the following Covid-19 related events, a number of contingencies are planned for. These are:</b></p><p><b>•	What happens when a lockdown occurs or social restrictions are introduced?  </b></p><p>In the event of lockdown or stringent social distancing, face-to-face seminars and activities will be moved online exclusively and teaching will continue through MS Teams. </p><p><b>•	What will happen if the lecturer is unwell? </b></p><p>Staff will stay at home if unwell, as directed by UWA Health advice. If symptoms are mild content will be delivered online during this time. </p><p>However, if the lecturer gets unwell, it may mean that weeks’ workshops/lectures may be delayed, as given the professional and specialised nature of the postgraduate programs a ‘substitute’ staff is not generally possible to find, especially on short notice. If this happens, staff will make arrangements with students to deliver these workshops/lectures as soon as possible after recovering by making arrangements that suit students. Delivering an increased number of lectures in a single week will be considered as the first possibility, as this avoids lectures going past week 12 of semester and final grades being delayed. However, if this is not possible, then these workshops/lectures will be delivered after week 12 of semester. We appreciate that this is not ideal, and see this as a temporary measure put in place to handle this extraordinary circumstance. Thanks for your understanding and patience as we try to bring you the best educational experience that we are able to.</p><p><b>•	What do students need to consider when they contract Covid? </b></p><p>If you are unwell you should not attend campus until you have recovered. This is to avoid the spread of illness among our staff and students. </p><p>If you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms (no matter how mild), you must immediately get tested and isolate until a negative result is returned. If you have returned a negative test but remain symptomatic you should stay home until you have recovered. We recommend you visit your doctor if your illness persists or worsens. </p><p>If you contract COVID, or have to self-isolate, all unit content will be made available to you remotely (online). If extensions to assessment deadlines are required, then UWA special consideration policies will apply.&nbsp;</p></p>

Students will be introduced to the latest research and insights in these areas and have opportunities to apply their learning in practice in class exercises and assignments.

                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Welcome to the unit PSYC5518: Teamwork. The offering of a whole unit dedicated to teamwork is a reflection of the importance of teamwork in workplaces. Teams are a key element of most organisations and are central to effective organisational performance. Teams can take many shapes or forms, can be created for a variety of objectives, and can be put in place for a variety of durations, ranging from a few hours to permanent. This unit covers various aspects of team work, including group dynamics and processes, team design, team effectiveness, personality and diversity in teams, shared mental models, and virtuality.&nbsp;</p><p>Students will be introduced to the latest research and insights in these areas and have opportunities to apply their learning in practice in class exercises and assignments. The unit prepares the students to be able to provide effective guidance to organisations regarding team work design, team composition and team processes.</p></p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Lecture Capture System</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>In accordance with UWA’s policy on lecture capture all lectures* in enabled venues will be recorded and made available to stream and download by enrolled students via the Lecture Capture System (LCS) for the duration of the unit (including Supplementary and Deferred Examinations period).

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>In this unit, you will be encouraged and facilitated to develop the ability and desire to:</p><p>•	Critically interpret scientific publications and other materials relating to the topics addressed in the unit;</p><p>•	Contribute to group discussions about these topics and publications;</p><p>•	Apply some of the methods and techniques outlined during the unit;</p><p>•	Work in team settings as well as on your own;</p><p>•	Clearly and convincingly present your findings and ideas in oral and written form.</p><p>This unit adopts a flipped classroom framework. This means that in most weeks, you will be expected to watch pre-recorded online videos before the scheduled lecture slot. This approach frees up our scheduled sessions for lots of activity focused learning. Within this overall framework, teaching and learning in this unit will take place through </p><p>•	reading and discussing scientific publications and various online materials relevant to the topics addressed in this unit, </p><p>•	lectures providing an overview of and links between unit content (online and for some face to face content)</p><p>•	presentations from guest speakers (online videos)</p><p>•	workshop-style classes and online sessions. </p><p>Assessments and activities have been designed to facilitate experiential learning with a practitioner oriented focus. Students will be given feedback regarding their learning as part of the class exercises and discussions. Time will be provided in class for work on group projects, but groups are expected to organise additional out-of-class meetings to coordinate their group's presentations and outputs. Note that there are a few activities included in this class that require out of class collaboration and preparation. </p><p>Students are encouraged to read widely beyond the required reading, and attend classes well prepared to join in discussions. Next to the required readings, references will also be given to recommend further reading materials, websites, and so on. You can also always ask the unit coordination for further readings! </p><p>If you have a question regarding a topic relevant to this unit, feel free to ask. If I don’t have an immediate answer, I will strive to get back to you with a response by the next session.<br></p></p></pre></p>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit offers both full online and a hybrid delivery mode.  </p><p>There will be scheduled weekly online classes, which students enrolled in online delivery mode should attend each week. Students enrolled in the face-to-face delivery mode also attend some of these online classes, except for  in weeks when a face-to-face class is scheduled – in those weeks they attend the face-to-face class instead of the online class.</p><p>Please enrol in the delivery mode that you intend to attend, so the unit coordinator knows who, and how many students, to expect when. Should there be a particular week in which you want to switch to the other delivery mode for the class of that week, check with the unit coordinator first.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you are unsure how the course works for you, follow this quick guide:</p><p><strong>Are you enrolled in online mode? </strong></p><p>--&gt; you attend all classes online each week</p><p>The online class is timetabled for 5pm to 8pm on a Monday.</p><p class=""><strong>Are you enrolled in face-to-face mode?</strong></p><p>--&gt; you attend class face to face during the weeks when these are scheduled – during these weeks you do not attend the online class</p><p>The face-to-face classes are scheduled for the following weeks:</p><p>•	Week 1 (28/02/2022)</p><p>•	Week 5 (28/03/2022)</p><p>•	Week 7 (11/042022)</p><p>•	Week 10 (03/05/2022)</p><p>The in-class sessions are timetabled on Mondays 9am – 12noon. </p><p>When a face-to-face class is scheduled, you do <u>not </u>need to attend the online session that week. </p><p>--&gt; when no face-to-face class is scheduled, you attend the online classes. </p><p>The online class is timetabled for 5pm to 8pm on a Monday. </p><p>Due to public holidays/ study break, there are no classes (online or face-to-face) on the 7th of March 2022 and the 18th and 25th of April 2022. During weeks where our class falls on a public holiday, you are expected to work on the assessments and a core activity that is part of the unit. The last class is scheduled for the 23rd of May 2021 -don’t miss that one, it is a lot of fun (at least for your lecturer 😉)!&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

If symptoms are mild content will be delivered online during this time.

However, if the lecturer gets unwell, it may mean that some weeks’ workshops/lectures may be delayed, as given the professional and specialised nature of the postgraduate programs a ‘substitute’ staff is not generally possible to find, especially on short notice. If this happens, staff will make arrangements with students to deliver these workshops/lectures as soon as possible after recovering by making arrangements that suit students. Delivering an increased number of lectures in a single week will be considered as the first possibility, as this avoids lectures going past week 12 of semester and final grades being delayed. However, if this is not possible, then these workshops/lectures will be delivered after week 12 of semester. We appreciate that this is not ideal, and see this as a temporary measure put in place to handle this extraordinary circumstance. Thanks for your understanding and patience as we try to bring you the best educational experience that we are able to.</p></pre></p><br />

This is to avoid the spread of illness among our staff and students.

If you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms (no matter how mild), you must immediately get tested and isolate until a negative result is returned. If you have returned a negative test but remain symptomatic you should stay home until you have recovered. We recommend you visit your doctor if your illness persists or worsens.

If you contract COVID, or have to self-isolate, all unit content will be made available to you remotely (online). If extensions to assessment deadlines are required, then UWA special consideration policies will apply.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
