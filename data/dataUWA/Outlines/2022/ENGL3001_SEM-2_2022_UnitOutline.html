                        <p><p>My approach is to try and run as much in-person as circumstances allow. All lectures will either be recorded or pre-recorded. Our tutorials are set up as face-to-face classes, with the capacity for online attendance for individuals studying externally. If we go into lockdown, or if a staff member has to isolate, then these will convert to online classes. If a student has to isolate, then you will be able to join an in-person tutorial remotely. If you have any concerns about this strategy, particularly in terms of managing your own health in the context of the pandemic,&nbsp; please contact me and we will facilitate your needs!</p></p>

                                    <td>This unit provides a study of poetry in English spanning the period from Medieval times to the present. Poetry is a rather marginalised art in contemporary Western societies, including Australia, but those involved in it tend to believe in its value passionately. This derives from the belief that poetry is the deepest form of human expression, certainly the most profound form that language ever attains. The unit examines poetry and poetic language both in analysis and in practice, covering technical and philosophical elements of poetry and relating them to shifts in cultural values in the society from which each work emerged. This unit combines the approaches of literary criticism and creative writing, allowing students to choose which approach they take up in assessment. 

As a Level 3 unit, this unit aims to further develop students' skills in creative and/or critical research, textual analysis and oral and written communication through focused engagements with specific texts and theories, and via an emphasis on independent learning through strategies such as targeted research tasks and creative projects. This prepares students for future studies at honours and postgraduate levels, or as innovative and productive researchers and communicators throughout their chosen careers.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit provides a study of poetry in English spanning the period from Medieval times to the present. Poetry is often seen as a marginalised art in contemporary Western societies, including Australia, but those involved in it tend to believe in its value passionately. This derives from the belief that poetry is the deepest form of human expression, certainly the most profound form that language ever attains. The unit examines poetry and poetic language both in analysis and in practice, covering technical and philosophical elements of poetry and relating them to shifts in cultural values in the society from which each work emerged. This unit combines the approaches of literary criticism and creative writing, allowing students to choose which approach they take up in assessment.</p><p>As a Level 3 unit, this unit aims to further develop students' skills in creative and/or critical research, textual analysis and oral and written communication through focused engagements with specific texts and theories, and via an emphasis on independent learning through strategies such as targeted research tasks and creative projects. This prepares students for future studies at honours and postgraduate levels, or as innovative and productive researchers and communicators throughout their chosen careers.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>The three essential elements of this unit are lectures, tutorials and personal reading. Lectures aim to provide a broad induction into the week's topic, contextualising it, introducing the poetry through its formal qualities and major concerns, and distilling critical debates. Tutorials allow us to deepen our understanding through discussion and collective focus. Your own reading of the primary texts is essential for getting the most out of the classes.&nbsp;<br></p><p>One of the recognised study skills in the humanities is speed reading, particularly in subjects where there is a large volume of material to cover. Understanding poetry, and gaining the most out of this unit, on the other hand, depends on 'slow reading' - that is, reading with the ear attuned to the sounds, as well as reading with the eye and the mind. Remember that poems are generally 'open texts' which allow multiple interpretations, and invite their readers to become co-creators of meaning. As you read, be attentive to the effect of any formal properties, such as rhythm or rhyme, and to the figurative dimensions of language. Give yourself time for re-reading and reflection. You are encouraged, when encountering poetry which is of particular interest or appeal to you, to read beyond the syllabus, by dipping into an anthology or the internet in order to find things you like or to get a sense of different styles.</p><p>Readings will be found on LMS, but there are weeks when you will be directed to versions of the set works in books or collections which might be of use in your learning. Purchasing these is not compulsory, but is encouraged. Each week there are also supporting critical readings to be found on LMS. These are not intended to be definitive, but to introduce you to critical debates. They are secondary to the primary works of the unit, the poems.</p><p><strong>Teaching in the Unit</strong></p><p>Face-to-face and/or online/recorded lectures (45mins) and face-to-face or online tutorials (1 x 2hrs pw). In the event COVID restrictions are imposed and prohibit face-to-face learning, all tutorials will go online via Collaborate on the LMS. Whether online or in person, I will expect all students to work with me in the tutorial space to develop an environment for conversation based on inclusion, informed engagement and enthusiasm for our pursuit.<strong><br></strong></p></p></pre></p>

As a genre, poetry creates productive ambiguity through connotation, symbolism and other techniques. The tutorial is a space where dialogue between different readings is encouraged, and where different perspectives can be developed, weighed up, compared, and refined. Regular engagement in discussion is a vital means of deepening our understanding of the genre.&nbsp;</p><p>Participation is graded as 20% of your final mark. Students are expected to listen to all lectures/podcasts, to attend all tutorials (whether on-campus or joining online), and participate actively in the tutorial activities and general discussions each week. Students are expected to have listened, read and understood the assigned weekly materials. The participation mark is based on active engagement in tutorial discussions and activities, and evidence of thorough engagement with the unit materials, including readings and lectures.&nbsp;</p><p>This mark will be assessed by your tutor over the course of the unit. Students' participation is assessed in two ways: 1) general participation in tutorial exercises and discussions, and 2) each student will be expected to complete a weekly exercise requiring either a critical or creative response. These exercises will need to be collated for submission via the LMS by the end of semester, and will be graded on a pass/fail completion basis.&nbsp;</p><p>Participation in class, whether it is listening to a lecture or getting involved in other activities, is an important part of the learning process. It is therefore important that you attend classes. More formally, the University regulations state that ‘to complete a course&nbsp; or unit students shall attend prescribed classes, lectures, seminars and tutorials’. Where a student, due to exceptional&nbsp; circumstances, is unable to attend a scheduled class, they are required to obtain prior approval of the unit coordinator to be absent from that class, or present evidence for special consideration. Any student absent from class without having had such absence approved by the unit coordinator may be referred to the faculty for advice and may be required to withdraw from the unit.&nbsp;</p><p>In the event of a COVID lockdown or the isolation of a staff member, tutorials will revert to on-line learning. Students will still be expected to listen to all lectures/podcasts, and to attend all on-line tutorials (via Collaborate on the LMS).</p></p></pre></p>

UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students. Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.

You are never compelled to watch or read a text if you do not want to for personal reasons, though you may be expected to complete alternate work in this instance.</p><p>Because these issues are personal, it is very hard to predict in advance for all students if certain performed scenes or themes may&nbsp; be upsetting. We therefore empower students to take responsibility for exercising discretion and encourage you to take reasonable precautions if you feel you are vulnerable; for example, by Googling texts and checking that they are not likely to contain material that you find upsetting.</p><p><strong>Seeking Support in the Unit</strong></p><p>Learning can be strenuous, and regularly life interferes in the learning process. We encourage all students who are finding the unit difficult, for any reason, to talk with the teaching team, so that we can best facilitate your needs in completing the unit. Special consideration will only be awarded in set circumstances, but we are willing to work with students to support your learning before you reach the point of requiring this level of intervention! Please do not hesitate to email/talk to your tutor or me: catherine.noske@uwa.edu.au&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Children in Classes</strong></p><p>This unit is designed to be a welcoming and inclusive space, and children will be welcome in the following circumstances:</p><p>- All children exclusively breastfeeding are very welcome in classes, lecture or tutorial.</p><p>- Any children older than this in the care of students, in the case of unforeseen circumstances or when other arrangements have failed, are very welcome in classes, lecture or tutorial.</p><p>We ask that all students respect this, and work with me to make sure that classes remain a welcoming and inclusive environment. In cases where babies/children do come to classes, we ask that carers make every effort to ensure they cause minimal disruption to&nbsp; the learning of other students. The university's formal policy on children in classes can be found here: <a href='http://www.hr.uwa.edu.au/policies/policies/conduct/children' target='_blank' >http://www.hr.uwa.edu.au/policies/policies/conduct/children</a></p><p><strong>Feedback</strong></p><p>We welcome all feedback to the unit, positive or negative, through SURF/SPOT surveys or informally - we rely on this feedback to continue developing the unit offerings! Please don't hesitate to get in touch via email if you would like to discuss the unit: catherine.noske@uwa.edu.au</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>

                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
                    </ul>
