The project is a capstone experience in which students integrate and apply knowledge and skills acquired in earlier units to a substantial real-world design challenge relevant to their discipline. Students work in teams, typically with four to six members, and are supervised by an academic and/or industry mentor. Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project are to lead students through a systematic engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare them for professional practice as engineers. The focus of the unit is the delivery of outcomes to a professional standard.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>This unit is taken over two semesters and parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. The project is a capstone experience in which students integrate and apply knowledge and skills acquired in earlier units to a substantial real-world design challenge relevant to their discipline. Students work in teams, typically with four to six members, and are supervised by an academic and/or industry mentor. Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project are to lead students through a systematic engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare them for professional practice as engineers. The focus of the unit is on teamwork skills and the design process.</p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>

You are expected to meet regularly with your team mates and with your client as appropriate. You should contact and meet with your client regularly. Everybody should keep a record of every meeting. Who was present, what was discussed, what tasks were assigned with what deadlines, and when the next meeting will be held. The weekly progress containing these details needs to be uploaded at Teams in form of "Team Accountability Document" as is done in CITS 5551. </p><p>There is a fornightly workshop/ consultation with the Unit coordinator to discuss any problem being faced.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember that you should be spending 10 hours a week on this unit and so the quantity of work should be proportional to that amount of time. You will lose marks if it is not clear that all team members have put in at least 100 hours per semester.</p><p>System Delivery (group/individual) (80%)</p><p>The following is further deliverables and marks distribution of&nbsp; 80% system delivery:<br></p><p>a)	A report of 5000 to 7000 words giving the details of the project (40%)<br></p><p>b)	User manual for the system (15%)</p><p>c)	Presentation ( face to face, all group members to present) (25%): The presentation will be roughly 20 minutes long and will review the project, demonstrate the software. You should also discuss what worked and what didn't work during the entire project.<br></p><p>d)	Professionalism (20%), Consult rubric to know the marking criteria for Professionalism.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Reflective Essay (20%, individual)</p><p>The essay component will require all students to write an individual essay. The essay should be 2,000 to 2,500 words. The essay should be a personal reflection of the project, what you individually learned and contributed. What worked well and what could have gone better. What means were used to communicate around project activities and milestones? Were they effective?</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>

                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
