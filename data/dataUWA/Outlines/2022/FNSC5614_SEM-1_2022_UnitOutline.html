                        <p><p>Q: What will happen to the unit in the event of lockdown, masking or stringent social distancing?</p><p>A: in the event of a lockdown lectures and some tutorial sessions will be moved online with labs/practical sessions deferred (see below).</p><p>Q: What will happen about practical and/or laboratory activates that cannot be undertaken remotely or online?</p><p>A: these will be block taught at the end of the semester and/or when appropriate advice allows us to do so safely following relevant Government mandates. Final examination dates may need to be moved accordingly to allow appropriate revision/preparation time.</p><p>Q: What will happen to the unit in the event of staff absence due to COVID-related reasons?</p><p>A: Where possible we will use replacement lecturer(s) and demonstrators. If this is not possible, we will move to an online delivery (where possible) and defer other activities (see above).</p><p>Q: What the implications for students in the unit are if they get COVID or have to self-isolate due to close contact?</p><p>A: Students are eligible for two-weeks special consideration as detailed above. This is intended to provide the required extensions to any assessable materials and/or practical activities. Any student having to isolate during testing or for other reasons will have access to streamed lectures via TEAMS (by prior arrangement with the unit coordinator). The relevant materials for missed practical session(s) will be provided at an alternative time.</p></p>

We will then introduce the concept of forensic archaeology and discuss its conception and relevance to modern forensic investigation. Special emphasis is placed on emphasising how and why the disciple has developed, its distinction from traditional (historic and prehistoric) archaeology, and how it is applied in forensic investigations. The ethical responsibilities of the forensic archaeologist are also discussed.</p><p>Lecture 2: Case study in forensic archaeology I</p><p>In this lecture students will be presented with two more examples of mass graves excavated by forensic  archaeologists. One of these relates to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the second dates to the First World War and fallen Australian soldiers in France. We will be outlining the differences and similarities between humanitarian and forensic projects. This lecture will reaffirm the various types of evidence that can be recovered from a crime scene by the forensic archaeologist and how that evidence crosses into other forensic disciplines (e.g. anthropology, entomology, chemistry).</p><p>Lecture 3: Case study in forensic archaeology II</p><p>This lecture is designed to introduce students to a Western Australian archaeological site that is essentially a 17th century crime scene; the infamous scene of the Batavia mutiny. In this lecture we will describe the excavation and analysis of a multiple burial on Beacon Island, in the Houtman Abrolhos, which recovered victims of the Batavia mutiny of 1629. We describe how forensic, archaeological and historical evidence is used to describe and interpret characteristics of the multiple burial in order to reconstruct events surrounding the mutiny.</p><p>Lecture 4: Forensic archaeological techniques I – survey theory</p><p>This lecture examines the ‘how’s and whys’ of forensic archaeological techniques (e.g. context, site surveying, measuring and recording equipment). The lecture begins by explaining why it is important to maintain evidence context in forensic investigations. It then examines techniques (such as walked transects) used to locate sites, and the use of automatic levels and Total Stations that allow accurate large-scale mapping. This is followed by a  discussion of techniques that record evidence at a small-scale, including grid squares and XYZ coordinates. Special emphasis is placed on why it is imperative to apply correct methodology in relation to court admissibility.</p><p>Lecture 5: Forensic archaeological techniques II – excavation methods &amp; legislation</p><p>There will frequently be subsurface evidence that requires special excavation and recording techniques to maintain the context of all associated artefacts. In this lecture we will examine the specific tools that are used in the removal of soil; the natural and cultural taphonomic site process that affect preservation, and methods of collecting and storing evidence, are also discussed. This lecture will also consider the various State legislations that govern archaeological excavation and how to prepare a standard report.</p><p>Lecture 6: Geophysics in forensic archaeology</p><p>There are a variety of geophysical instruments available to the forensic investigator that can be used at, or close to, the ground surface to probe its subsurface composition. Buried objects (e.g. drugs, money, weapons) structures (e.g. bunkers) and clandestine graves are encountered in forensic casework – one of the most effective and non-invasive methods of detecting such items is through the application of surveys involving a ground penetrating radar and/or a caesium-vapour gradiometer. This lecture will focus on the latter instruments and describe their basic principles, operation, survey methodology and data interpretation in the context of searching for clandestine burials.</p><p>PRACTICAL SERIES</p><p>Practical 1: Survey theory</p><p>Lecture 4 provided the theory behind a selection of pertinent forensic archaeological surveying techniques; this practical session will provide demonstrations of, and hands on experience in, the use of measuring and recording equipment. This includes how to set up and use a theodolite and/or total station. Appropriate methodologies for stringing out a trench and coordinate point mapping are also demonstrated. </p><p>Practical 2: Recovery and interpretation of forensic evidence</p><p>At this stage of the course the students have now had a series of lectures and practical sessions describing the appropriate forensic techniques required to identify and excavate a human burial. This practical session is specifically designed to take students beyond the simple exhumation and retrieval of human remains, and describe how the forensic archaeologist must be able to reconstruct human activity at the site and beyond. As such, we will demonstrate how the grave itself, plus other forensic evidence contained within and around the grave (whether environmental or anthropogenic) is just as important as the human remains for reconstructing events at the crime scene. Students will be required to work in groups to analyse and provide their interpretation of an actual forensic archaeological case scenario. </p><p>Practical 3: Geophysical survey – practical demonstration</p><p>This session involves a practical demonstration of a ground penetrating radar survey. This will include a basic description of the equipment used (Mala® GPR) and the appropriate methodology for setting up and performing a survey.  NOTE: this is not a training exercise, but rather a practical demonstration of the potential utility of remote sensing in forensic casework.</p><p>Practical 4: Documentation and excavation of a mock crime scene</p><p>This practical exercise is designed to allow students to apply the forensic theory and method thus far assimilated in a mock crime scene involving the location and exhumation of a burial. As current legislation does not allow us to use human subjects, students will be excavating a suitable analogue, which has been buried in a manner closely approximating the inhumation of a child or small adult. Participants will be required to follow through all the necessary steps to analyse the crime scene, culminating in the recovery of the buried remains. The practical is assessed on the basis of individual input and demonstration of competence during the session and the submission of a final report. Duration – 1 full day. </p><p>Practical 5: Post-excavation data reconciliation</p><p>This practical exercise is designed to allow students to reconcile the data collected during practical sessions and plan a professional archaeological report. Students should come to class with completed recording forms and a first draft of the report. Templates are available on LMS. </p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
