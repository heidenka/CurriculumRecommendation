The unit should offer you some ways to consider educational leadership, rather than providing you with a manual for ‘How to be a successful leader’. Put simply, educational leadership is concerned with providing direction, resources, and support to educators and students for the purpose of improving teaching and learning, and the curriculum, across a range of educational settings. This unit begins by describing the current international context of social and educational policy developments. Different ways in which educational leadership has been conceptualised are then investigated. Recent research will also be examined to provide insights into contemporary thinking about educational leadership before looking at some specific issues relating to current practice. Finally, you will be asked to synthesise and apply the understandings you have gained from your reading and participation in tutorials to your own professional context.</p><p>Unit Outcomes</p><p>The educational outcomes governing this unit are listed below. On completion of this unit, you should be able to:</p><p>identify and analyse international, national and state level policies and practices relevant to educational leadership;</p><p>describe a range of theories relevant to the field of educational leadership and evaluate their appropriateness to the contemporary educational environment;</p><p>relate theories of educational leadership to personal experiences and practices through a process of reflection and discussion; analyse leadership issues in the context of educational organisations; and</p><p>consider strategies to improve educational organisations and reflect on the values that underpin them.</p><p>Learning outcomes</p><p>Students are able to (1) explain theory relevant to the field of educational leadership; (2) critically analyse international, national and</p><p>state-level policies and practices relevant to educational leadership; (3) relate theories of educational leadership to personal</p><p>experiences and practices through a process of reflection and discussion; and (4) demonstrate a capacity to think about leadership</p><p>issues and problem solving in relation to educational organisations.</p></p></pre></p>

W hereas transactional leadership tends to be concerned with the mechanics of the leadership process and reasserts traditional organisational hierarchy, transformational leadership provides a perspective that  is trained towards the outcomes of  leadership. Transformational leadership takes on a new lexicon which uses terminology such as empowerment and enablement of staff at all levels of the organization. It proposes that leadership is not something to be exercised only by those in formal positions of authority, rather opportunities need to be provided for everyone in the organisation to engage in leadership activity.</p><p>Readings:</p><p>Bush, T. &amp; Glover, L.

We have already seen that in this turbulent situation a different kind of leadership seems to be required from that which applied to schools operating in less complicated and relatively stable circumstances. There are no standard procedures for dealing with unremitting government initiatives and increasing pressures from the community. Therefore, it appears that leadership now, more than ever, needs to build the capacity of the school community to deal effectively with the change process. Schools may need to adopt not only new missions, but also new structures and relationships in response to the changing environment. Hence, this section of the unit looks at the role of ‘new’ educational leadership in accomplishing meaningful and sustainable change.</p><p>Readings:</p><p>Morrison, K. (2002).

In particular, a sensitivity to the ‘culture’ of the school enables leaders to influence the nurturing of values, beliefs and attitudes that are fundamental to establishing and sustaining  a  learning  environment.  The  importance  of  leaders  being  able  to  understand  and  engage  with  the  culture  of  their organisations raises certain fundamental questions such as: W hat exactly is the nature of organisational culture?

It also entails creating conditions that enable people to work together in order to construct meaning and develop a shared purpose or set of goals. In practice, this means giving authority to teachers and empowering them to lead. This section of the unit looks at the characteristics of ‘teacher leadership’, as well as what the research has to say about its advantages and the ways in which teacher leadership can be facilitated or impeded.</p><p>Readings</p><p>Barth, R.

In the United States this is described as ‘instructional leadership’. However, this term does tend to suggest that it is concerned mainly with the process of teaching, whereas learning-centred leadership denotes a more student-centred concept. Widening the definition further, leadership of learning concerns itself with learning that runs right through the organisation and may be described as ‘organisational learning’. Allied to that notion is the more recent idea of ‘dispersed’ or ‘distributive’ leadership which sees all members of the community as exercising, or having the potential to exercise, leadership. It addresses the issue of agency – who exercises it? – in the process of school improvement. In similar vein, is the concept of leadership known as 'pedagogical leadership’ which emphasises the development of the school through the development of others. Similarly, pedagogical leadership invests in capacity building by developing social and academic capital for students and intellectual and professional capital for teachers. This concept differs, therefore, from existing leadership theories because it is concerned with adding value by developing various forms of human capital. For many school leaders these ideas may be seen as novel, vague, unrealistic or simply untenable given the demands which they are required to meet and the dilemmas requiring resolutions on a daily basis. For others these ideas coincide with their practice or present a challenge to which school leaders are eager to rise.</p><p>Readings:</p><p>Macbeath, J. (2006).

For both schools and communities, this means crossing traditional boundaries and making connections that go beyond traditional roles and community norms. It would seem that the development of effective and sustainable school–community partnerships is most likely to be facilitated by a collaborative leadership process, in which school and community together develop and enact a shared vision. However, the effectiveness of this process appears to depend on the extent to which collaborative practices are already in place within the school and community. The need for educators to foster collaborative leadership processes in order to bring about and support sustainable change within their schools, is supported by research into effective educational leadership. This section explores ways in which interaction between the school and community can help initiate and sustain school improvement.</p><p>Readings:</p><p>Clarke, S., &amp; W ildy, H. (2004).

These circumstances are characterised by increasing intensity and complexity that engender a level of environmental turbulence requiring different kinds of leadership from those which apply to organisations operating in less complicated and relatively stable circumstances. For example, there has been a good deal of recent interest in leadership of multi-ethnic schools. A significant finding of leadership research indicates that context matters and yet empirical research into leadership of organisations tends to lack such sensitivity to context. Hence, this part of the unit is concerned with examining the complexity of leaders’ work in specific contexts and the various ways in which this complexity is dealt with.</p><p>Key questions include:</p><p>W hat issues and influences do leaders in educational organisations face as they perform their day-to-day work in challenging circumstances?</p><p>What is the nature of the context within which these issues and influences arise?</p><p>W hat strategies do leaders of organisations adopt in order to deal with the complexities of their work and why do they adopt these strategies?</p><p>How might leadership be conceptualised within distinctive environments?</p><p>Readings:</p><p>Walker,  A.

For example, The National Policy Board for Educational Administration in the United States (1995) has described the nature of the challenge facing school principals in this way:</p><p>Tomorrow's educational leaders must be able to work with diverse groups and to integrate ideas to solve a continuous flow of problems. They must study their craft as they practise their craft reflecting and then applying what they have learned to people and institutions and the achievement of tasks. This requires patience and perspective, the exercise of judgement and wisdom, and the development of new technical and analytical skills. It also demands sensitivities to other cultures and highly developed communications skills. Finally, it requires personal values that integrate the ethical dimensions of decision making with those of a more technical variety.

Each person speaks briefly about how they understand educational leadership and how these understandings are played out in practice. Individual presentations are followed by questions and discussion about what leadership means in the contemporary educational environment.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
