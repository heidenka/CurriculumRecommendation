Both parts must be completed in order to achieve a mark for the units.

The unit allows students to develop research skills and comprises a research project in the field of architecture. Research topics may be in either critical studies, design or technical studies, and are to be agreed on between the student and a nominated supervisor and approved by the unit coordinator. Students may have the opportunity to develop topics in association with industry partners or mentors. The Independent Research unit aims to train and assess students' abilities to contribute to the future development of their discipline through research that extends existing knowledge and/or through the creative application of knowledge in ways likely to impact upon future thinking in their fields of study. Study is based on independent research rather than taught coursework and the learning and assessment practices intentionally parallel those of postgraduate research studies.

Independent Research requires the development and demonstration of ability and acquired competence. It is expected that, in addition to addressing a project brief, students establish theoretical parameters  that form the basis for investigation. While projects may vary in scale, and exhibit varying levels of complexity, students are required to incorporate the full range of knowledge and skills required for a fully resolved proposition or dissertation. Projects of an experimental nature are encouraged.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit is offered in two parts, which may be taken either concurrently (18 credit points in one semester), or consecutively over two semesters (6 credit points in one semester then 12 credit points the following semester). Both parts must be completed in order to achieve a mark for the units.</p><p>The unit allows students to develop research skills and comprises a research project in the field of architecture. Research topics may be in either critical studies, design or technical studies, and are to be agreed on between the student and a nominated supervisor and approved by the unit coordinator. Students may have the opportunity to develop topics in association with industry partners or mentors. The Independent Research unit aims to train and assess students' abilities to contribute to the future development of their discipline through research that extends existing knowledge and/or through the creative application of knowledge in ways likely to impact upon future thinking in their fields of study. Study is based on independent research rather than taught coursework and the learning and assessment practices intentionally parallel those of postgraduate research studies.</p><p>Independent Research requires the development and demonstration of ability and acquired competence. It is expected that, in addition to addressing a research proposal or a project brief, students establish theoretical parameters that form the basis for investigation. While projects may vary in scale, and exhibit varying levels of complexity, students are required to incorporate the full range of knowledge and skills required for a fully resolved proposition or dissertation. Projects of an experimental nature are encouraged.</p><p>Part 2 of the research pathway is the 12 point unit in which the major project will be completed, having been framed and prepared in Part 1 (ARCT5010). The project will take the form of either a written dissertation or a design project. In either case, the project is independently directed with the guidance of a supervisor.<br></p></p></pre></p>

Meeting times and venues are to be independently arranged between individual students and supervisors.</p><p>Two or three times through the semester, students will be required to make presentations of their work to the group of research students and supervisors. These are for formative feedback and intended to support peer interaction and advancement of confidence and proficiency in articulating ideas, methods, objectives and conclusions relating to research projects.</p><p>Unit Learning Outcomes:</p><p>Students are able to (1) demonstrate the capacity to develop and respond to the requirements set out in a coherent architectural project brief (design) or proposal (dissertation); (2) clearly state and sustain a thesis, with a clearly substantiated argument and critical engagement with material; (3) develop a relevant bibliography of information, literature and precedent sources and research a chosen architectural topic to a substantial depth; (4) develop a sound theoretical basis and a high conceptual and project quality, with an appropriate level of resolution, depending on the nature of the project; and (5) clearly and effectively communicate architectural ideas and write in accordance with academic protocols.<br></p></p></pre></p>

In all cases, requests for extensions require the submission of Special Consideration form no later than three University working days after the due date.</p><p>Students are strongly encouraged to familiarise themselves with the Policy on Special Consideration available at <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&amp' target='_blank' >http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&amp</a>;id=UP11%2F23</p><p><strong><u>Feedback </u></strong></p><p>Marked assessments submitted on time will be made available for collection by students at least one week before the next assessment in the unit is due (if it is related to the previous assessment), or no more than 15 University working days after submission, whichever is sooner.</p><p>Building clean-up and folio collection (for units with folio submissions)</p><p>Studios are expected to be left clean and tidy. Drawing boards are to be cleaned. Students must remove all personal property immediately after the submission of their folio. If the content of a folio is used for exhibition then the student must write their name on the back of the work so that when the exhibition is demounted collection is simplified. If staff or the Faculty wish to reserve work for reproduction and/or accreditation purposes then this should be negotiated with individual students.</p><p><strong><u>Charter of student rights and responsibilities </u></strong></p><p>The Charter of Student Rights and Responsibilities upholds the fundamental rights of students who undertake their education at the University of Western Australia.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
