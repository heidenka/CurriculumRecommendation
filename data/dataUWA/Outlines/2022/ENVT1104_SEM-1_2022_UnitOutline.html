Essential concepts in environmental physics, chemistry and biology are introduced throughout each module to develop essential knowledge and skills within the broader context of environmental science. This material forms the basis of more focused content delivered in Levels 2 and 3 of the Environmental Science and Geographical Science majors. 

The unit content is delivered through modules related to: climate change and carbon pollution; catchment development and water resource management; biodiversity loss and conservation; land degradation; coastal systems; and cities. Through these lenses, the unit looks to explain lessons from the past using both local and global examples to ensure students establish the connection between environmental processes and the manifestation of environmental degradation and recovery.  Tutorial sessions are included to complement key lectures to encourage students to participate in activities related to problem identification and conceptualisation, and critical assessment of diverse information sources. In addition, each module has a component related to data analysis and the development of written and oral communication skills.</td>

Essential concepts in environmental physics, chemistry and biology are introduced throughout each module to develop essential knowledge and skills within the broader context of environmental science. This material forms the basis of more focused content delivered in Levels 2 and 3 of the Environmental Science major.</p></p></pre></p>

You are expected to attend and attendance records will be taken at each workshop session. The format of each workshop will vary from week to week and in general workshop sessions have been designed to support your understanding of the learning material provided via the LMS, in addition to providing a pathway to successful assessment grades. Details of each assessment item will be provided in workshop sessions as well as support to complete these assessments successfully. Absence from workshop classes and failure to submit assignments without good reason are likely to result in failure of the unit.</p><p>Please note you will be required to attend to workshop classes specifically related to your unit grade as follows: (1) oral presentation assessment during your normal workshop class in week 7. If you cannot attend you must apply for special consideration and an alternative session must be attended. (2) Workshop class in week 12 of semester where there will be a compulsory practical class quiz – this is a face to face quiz and will not run online. If you cannot attend you must apply for special consideration and an alternative session must be attended.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
