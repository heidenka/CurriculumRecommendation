                    <p>ACCT3321 - ACCT3321_SEM-1_2022 - SEM-1-2022 - 2022 - Face to face / Blended learning</p>
                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Welcome to ACCT3321 Financial Accounting: Theory and Practice!</p><p>The focus of the unit is accounting and public company financial reporting. We explore select current accounting standards and practices and reasons for these practices. In addition, we consider the setting in which financial and sustainability reporting occurs and the influences on the reporting process. Completing this unit should equip you with an understanding of the financial reporting environment and important principles and procedures associated with the preparation of listed companies' financial statements. A further objective of the unit is to assist you to develop your ability to consider, analyse and research complex issues, to formulate well-reasoned and coherent arguments and to reach appropriate conclusions and make required judgements.</p><p>The unit coordinator and lecturer for this unit is Dr Lyndie Bayne. Lyndie is a qualified chartered accountant with extensive university lecturing experience in both financial accounting and management accounting. She has a diverse academic background, with degrees in Economics, Accounting and Mathematical Statistics, an Honours degree in Economics, a Masters degree in Commerce and a PhD in Accounting. Lyndie's research interests include corporate disclosures and performance indicators; in particular the interface between corporate reporting versus practice in the sustainability area.</p></p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Lecture Capture System</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>In accordance with UWA’s policy on lecture capture all lectures* in enabled venues will be recorded and made available to stream and download by enrolled students via the Lecture Capture System (LCS) for the duration of the unit (including Supplementary and Deferred Examinations period).

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>The unit has a face-to-face two-hour lecture each week which is recorded and available on LMS using the LCS. Where needed, additional online lectures will be made available on LMS, which complements the face-to-face lectures. You must attend your one-hour tutorial each week, commencing in Week 2.</p><p>This unit includes team-based learning. You will be allocated to a team in the fourth week of the semester (allocation of teams is similar to real life where you don't generally choose you co-workers). You must work with your team throughout the semester and you are not permitted to change into another team or to attend a different tutorial. The team-based learning approach requires that you participate in all team activities and you will be assessed by your peers on your contribution to team activities (using SPARKPLUS).</p><p>The approach to learning is cumulative and reflective. That is, each week builds on the prior week/s and you need to reflect on what you are learning each week to see how the topics fit together. You need to monitor your own learning on a weekly basis and take action (self-study, reading the textbook, completing practice and demonstration problems, discussion with class members, posting questions on discussion boards) to ensure that you understand the material presented to you on a weekly basis. In addition, the teaching staff will be available for consultation prior to the final examination and for individual consultation by appointment.</p><p>It is your responsibility to prepare for individual and team activities prior to attending the tutorials and tests. Preparation is based on course materials (the prescribed Loftus et al. (2020) (3rd ed.) textbook and additional resources provided on LMS).</p><p>To gain the most from this unit you are encouraged to adopt the following strategy:</p><p>1) Read the assigned chapters of the textbook and additional readings: this introduces the topics and provides a comprehensive review of the material you need to know.</p><p>2) Attend (or listen to) the lecture and online additional lectures: this will contextualise the readings and review additional areas not sufficiently developed.</p><p>3) Attempt the practice questions set each week (see lecture slides for allocated questions). The solutions to the practice questions are available on LMS. You are strongly encouraged to make a solid attempt at answering these questions BEFORE looking at solutions (at least 3 to 4 hours preparation is expected each week). This will put you in the best position to focus on areas of concern during the tutorials.</p><p>4) In your tutorial, we will provide additional practice questions which will be the focus of the tutorial and will be discussed in groups. Tutorial solutions will be uploaded on LMS by Friday 10am following the tutorials.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

The School follows the UWA marks and grades distribution:<div><p>Higher distinction (HD) 80-100%</p><p>Distinction (D) 70-79%</p><p>Credit Pass (CR) 60-69%</p><p>Pass (P) 50-59%</p><p>Fail (N+) 45-49%</p><p>Fail (N) 0-44%</p><p>Failed component (FC)</p><p>The moderation of marks to ensure comparability between classes is an acceptable academic practice. The School and Board of Examiners have the right to moderate marks where it is considered necessary to maintain consistency and fairness.</p><p>Using peer feedback to assess team contributions</p><p>The online tool SPARKPLUS will be to used to assess individual contributions to group assessments. You will be required to provide feedback to, and receive feedback from, your team members. Based on a series of answers from each team member SPARKPLUS automatically produces two weighting factors: your RPF and SAPA. The use of SPARKPLUS will be explained in class and more information is available on LMS. *Note that a penalty may apply for non-completion of SPARKPLUS. Your individual mark for a group test is obtained by multiplying the group mark by your RPA. For example, if your group got 80% and you have an RPF of 0.8 than you get a mark of 80%x.8 = 64%. If you have an RPF of 1.1, then your individual mark is 80%x1.1 = 88%.</p><p>Quality assurance</p><p>Your assessed work may also be used for quality assurance purposes, such as to assess the level of achievement of learning outcomes as required for accreditation and audit purposes. The findings may be used to inform changes aimed at improving the quality of Business School programs. All material used for such processes will be treated as confidential, and the outcome will not affect your grade for the unit.</p><p>Approved calculators for examinations</p><p>The University permits only the use of calculators in examinations when the calculator has an approved sticker and the examiner permits their use. If the student does not have an approved sticker on their calculator, they will not be permitted to use the calculator. Calculators can be approved at the Undergraduate Student Centre, the Postgraduate Student Centre or at Student Administration. Further information is available on the Business School website at www.business.uwa.edu.au/students/assessments</p><p>eBooks and open book exams</p><p>eBooks cannot be accessed at an examination.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
