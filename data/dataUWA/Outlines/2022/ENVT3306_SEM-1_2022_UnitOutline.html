Through a combination of lectures, practical work and local field visits, students are introduced to conservation and management activities at the domestic and international level taken in response to contemporary human impacts on our coasts. Central themes include measures designed to reduce coastal water and sediment contamination from both point and non-point sources, policies to facilitate the conservation of marine flora and fauna and practices designed to mitigate the physical impacts of sea level rise in an inherently dynamic environment. The success or otherwise of these measures are assessed from a variety of environmental, social and economic perspectives in order to facilitate students' critical understanding of conservation and management in coastal regions. Through studying the unit, students gain a holistic appreciation of the unique threats facing coastal ecosystems and our ability to address these successfully.</td>

It should be of interest to anyone concerned with how we can conserve and sustain the ecological and environmental assets and values associated with our coast.</p><p>Coastal conservation and management has evolved from coastal engineering, whereby policies were designed to reduce threats to property and infrastructure, to the present day focus on minimising resource conflict through policies which address values held by multiple stakeholders and reflect the dynamic, unpredictable and varied nature of coastal environments.<br></p><p>This unit will commence with an examination of how such a management approach reflects contemporary debates over environmental vulnerability and resilience in the context of climate change on the coast. It will then move on to examining the nature of human threats in the context of common coastal habitats in the temperate and tropical regions, illustrating the significance and impacts of these through case studies and tutorial discussions. The unit will then analyse responses to these threats within each coastal ecosystem, considering how managers seek to enhance resilience and minimize vulnerability through a range of policies and measures. The design and management of marine protected areas will form a specific area of focus with reference to tropical environments. The unit will conclude with a discussion of issues affecting our ability to manage coastal ecosystems in a future dominated by the impacts of climate change. Tutorials will be used to explore this content in more depth through in-depth reading and discussion of key issues and guest presentations. We very much hope that this unit provides students with the information and opportunity to become involved in the future conservation and sustainable management of our coastal resources.<br></p></p></pre></p>

After initial exposition of the underlying core disciplinary content, case-studies are used to demonstrate the need for an interdisciplinary approach to management, and the practical challenges in coming to solutions that satisfy diverse stakeholder groups.</p><p>The initial 6 weeks of modules focuses on physical and water quality aspects associated with coastal ecosystem management, exploring the underlying threatening processes (e.g. sea level rise, pollution, acidification), and then looking at adaptation or restoration options. The second 6 weeks of modules transitions the focus to look at fishery management and holistic approaches to manage for resilience across local to global scales.</p><p>On completion of the the modules students will be able to demonstrate how the science that underpins our understanding of coastal ecosystems and conservation strategies can be used to support government and community responses.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

Marks will be deducted for inadequate, or poor quality referencing. Complete details of these works should be arranged alphabetically in a reference list at the end of any document or report you submit. </p><p>This unit spans several disciplinary areas that can use different styles. Submission for assignments in this unit prefers the use of either the Harvard or the APA reference style. The style chosen must be used consistently throughout any document. These may be accessed at: <a href='http://www.studentservices.uwa.edu.au/ss/learning/studying_smarter/jump_start/referencing' target='_blank' >http://www.studentservices.uwa.edu.au/ss/learning/studying_smarter/jump_start/referencing</a> or <a href='http://www.library.uwa.edu.au/education_training_and_support/guides' target='_blank' >http://www.library.uwa.edu.au/education_training_and_support/guides</a> </p><p><u>(a) Text referencing </u></p><p>There are standard procedures for referring to authors and their work, for example: </p><p>  1. Smith and Brown (2006) supported the interpretation…. </p><p>  2. … when recognising two inseparable criteria of experience; continuity and interaction (Clandinin &amp; Connelly 2000). </p><p>  3. When referring to a specific page or pages of a reference: Labaree (2006 p. 17); (Labaree 2006 p.17), Labaree (2006 pp.17-18) </p><p>  4. When referring to more than one work by the same author(s): Fink and Brayman (2004, 2006) </p><p>  5. When referring to more than one work in the same year: Hargreaves (2005a), Hargreaves (2005b) </p><p>  6. When there are TWO authors: (Tilbury &amp; Wortman 2003); Tilbury and Wortman (2003) </p><p>  7. When there are THREE or more authors: (Leithwood et al., 1999) Note: in the reference list, multiple authors should be listed in full. </p><p>  8. When referring to a publication that has no specific author, but which was written by an organization: (UNESCO 1992). </p><p><u>(b) Reference list </u></p><p>All work referenced in the text must also be included (in alphabetical order by author) in the reference list at the end of the assignment. </p><p>  1. <u>Book</u>: Diamond, J., 2005. Guns, germs and steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years. Vintage Press, London. </p><p>  2. <u>Article/Chapter in a book</u>: Fink, D 2000, The attrition of educational change over time: The case of ‘innovative’, ‘model’, ‘lighthouse’ schools, In The sharp edge of educational change: Teaching, leading and the realities of reform, eds N Bascia &amp; A Hargreaves, Falmer Press, London, pp. 29-51. </p><p>  3. <u>Article in a journal:</u> Hargreaves, A., 2005. Leadership succession, The Educational Forum, 69(2): 163-174. </p><p>  4. <u>Government publication</u>: Department of Environment and Heritage 1999, Today shapes tomorrow: Environmental education for a sustainable future, Environment Australia, Canberra. </p><p><strong>PLAGIARISM </strong></p><p>UWA has a Policy on Plagiarism that is available from the School Offices. It is expected that work submitted for assessment by a University student is the students’ own work, and that any contribution from others (ideas, facts or direct quotations) is given suitable acknowledgement by referring to the source (in a list of references, an acknowledgements section or in some other appropriate way). If such acknowledgement is not given, the writer is guilty of plagiarism. Plagiarism is the use of published work (book, articles, reports) or the work of other students (present or past, at this or any other University), as though it were one`s own. In some cultures, it is regarded as a sign of respect to describe events or ideas in exactly the same words as an acknowledged expert. In the academic tradition to which this University belongs, it is not; it is thought of as mere copying. Note that your project submissions will be assessed via the LMS “TurnItIn” plagiarism detection tool. Special care is necessary in the case of group work. Where a single report is required from a group of several students, it will be assumed that all students have contributed. Students not happy with the contribution of other group members should make appropriate representations to the appropriate staff member. Where each student is required to hand in an individual report based on group research, work of another individual student (eg diagrams, photographs) should be acknowledged. Unfortunately, students have been penalised by many Schools within the University, including this one, for plagiarism. If in any doubt, discuss the matter with your tutor or the unit coordinators. You may also access the plagiarism portal at : <a href='http://www.studentservices.uwa.edu.au/ss/learning/studying_smarter/jump_start/referencing' target='_blank' >http://www.studentservices.uwa.edu.au/ss/learning/studying_smarter/jump_start/referencing</a></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>

                        <li>serious injury</li>
                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
