                                    <td>This unit provides a comprehensive introduction to the major social, cultural and political issues that characterise contemporary China. A number of important issues are explored including the ongoing transformation of the Communist Party of China and its relationship with society; the development of a nascent civil society and public sphere; the current state of rural China; the features of urbanisation; the significance of increased mobility and migration; the impact of economic development on social life and the environment; various issues relating to ethnic identity and culture; the state of gender relations; the role of intellectual life and spaces for social critique; and the significance of globalisation for Chinese society and culture in general. 

Much of what is assumed to be known about China involves certain presuppositions and assumptions about the nature of political, social and cultural change. Students learn to distinguish the different presuppositions and assumptions which inform different approaches (e.g. media, business and state) to understanding China in the modern world. Students gain a solid base of knowledge and research skills relevant to the study of China in Asian Studies and Chinese Studies. They gain critical knowledge of the important social and political forces which are shaping contemporary China. They are trained and given the opportunity to apply various theories and modes of critical thought relating to the study of contemporary China.</td>

There is no doubt that China will emerge as one of the key players on the global scene within the next few decades. Therefore, it is imperative for anyone desiring to do business with China, or anyone who merely wishes to keep abreast of the latest developments in the unfolding of world history, to understand the forces that are shaping Chinese society. This unit is for students who are desirable to learn more about contemporary China and the significance of its rise in the twenty-first century.</p><p>This unit provides a comprehensive introduction to contemporary China's significant social, cultural, and political issues. </p><p>Several important issues are explored, including:</p><p>(1) the historical foundations of the politics and society of contemporary China,</p><p>(2) the ongoing transformation of the Communist Party of China and its relationship with the Chinese society,</p><p>(3) the current state of rural China, </p><p>(4) the features of China's urbanisation, and </p><p>(5) the various players continually shaping China's politics and society (such as civil society organisations, religious groups, ethnic groups, and social classes).</p><p>Much of what is assumed to be known about China involves certain presuppositions and assumptions about the nature of political, social and cultural change. This unit trains students to distinguish the different presuppositions and assumptions which inform different approaches to understanding China in the modern world. Students will gain a solid base of knowledge and research skills relevant to the study of China in Asian Studies and Chinese Studies. They learn critical knowledge of the significant social and political forces shaping contemporary China. They are trained and allowed to apply various theories and modes of critical thought relating to the study of contemporary China.</p><p>This unit also aims to equip students with knowledge of frontier theoretical and methodological breakthroughs that political sociologists have recently made to enable more in-depth study into contemporary China. As Professor Elizabeth J. Perry (1989: 590) described, Contemporary China "offers an excellent laboratory for the study of state-society relations". When the gap between disciplinary social scientific studies and area studies appears to be getting more extensive, this course encourages students to reflect on the relationships between political sociology and China studies in particular, and between disciplinary and area studies in general.</p><p>Specifically, this unit invites students to develop their understanding of the following pair of interrelated questions:</p><p>1. What insights the existing theoretical and methodological frameworks in social science (particularly political sociology) may help us make better sense of contemporary China?</p><p>2. What lessons from the studies on the state and society in contemporary China may contribute to further theoretical and methodological breakthroughs in social science (particularly political sociology)?</p><p>Knowing Chinese is not a prerequisite of this unit, but students with such skills can familiarise themselves with relevant Chinese language sources.</p></p></pre></p>

The students are expected to read all required readings, and as much as the recommended readings, before attending the lecture and seminars.</p><p>The lecture-tutorial sessions will not only give the students an overview of the topic of the week but also opportunities for discussions and debates on the subject. Feel free to interrupt the lecturer with relevant questions at any time during the lecture.</p><p>In the seminar sessions, the students are expected to play even more active roles. Indeed, seminars are cooperative learning activities, and a student-centred approach will be implemented throughout all seminar sessions in this unit. The seminar sessions are devoted to student-led presentations and discussions. All participants are highly encouraged to challenge each other's arguments (including those of my own) through logically-coherent counter-arguments and in a polite and civilised manner.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
                    <p>If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend</li>
