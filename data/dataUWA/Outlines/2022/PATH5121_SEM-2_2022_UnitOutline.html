                        <h3>Teaching contingency plan (In response to Covid19 restrictions)</h3>
                        <p><p>To the extent feasible, PATH5121 will proceed with face-to-face teaching. Students will be expected to attend PATH5121 classes when it’s safe to do so. However, please be aware that some classes may be disrupted, possibly at short-notice due to COVID-19. So before setting out to attend any PATH5121 session, make a point to check your email or LMS for announcements. If a session needs to be rearranged at short notice, an announcement will be posted to LMS and circulated to student email accounts.</p><p>Lectures - If circumstances prevent a PATH5121 lecture from proceeding face-to-face, the lecture will either proceed as a live-stream via MS Teams, or it will be postponed to a more suitable time. If neither of these options are viable, a pre-recorded screen-capture recording (with audio) will be posted to LMS. If a real-time lecture can proceed (either face-to-face or live-streamed), a screen-capture recording (with audio) will normally be posted to LMS within 24 hours.</p><p>If you know you’re going to be absent from a face-to-face lecture due to illness or COVID-19 isolation requirements, and you would like to follow the lecture online in real time, you may email the unit coordinator to request a live-stream via MS Teams. If the request can be facilitated, a link to the live-stream will be posted into the corresponding folder in LMS. However, please understand that this may not always be feasible. This option should not be used to replace a face-to-face lecture when it’s otherwise safe for you to attend.</p><p>Tutorials - if circumstances prevent a face-to-face PATH5121 tutorial from proceeding, the unit coordinator will advise alternative arrangements via LMS and student emails. Some tutorials may be suitable to be adapted for delivery online as a live-stream through MS Teams; other tutorials might be better adapted as a self-directed exercise using resources posted in LMS. Arrangements will be made as the needs arise, and will be announced via LMS and email, as above for lectures. Note that unlike lectures, PATH5121 tutorials will not normally be recorded. <br></p><p>There are five laboratory exercises scheduled for PATH5121. One of these involves calculations only and not a physical lab class. There will be a written assessment associated with each, typically due about 2 weeks after the session. If the COVID-19 situation prevents a student (or the class as a whole) from attending any of the physical laboratory classes, then alternative arrangements will be arranged as required, eg. re-scheduling.</p><p>Quizzes - there are 5 assessed quizzes scheduled during the semester for PATH5121. Quizzes will be conducted face-to-face whenever it’s possible. Students who are unable to attend a quiz may be rescheduled according to Special Considerations processes through Student Experience. In the event that the unit coordinator is unable to attend a scheduled quiz, the quiz will be invigilated by other university staff, for marking by the unit coordinator. If a quiz cannot be conducted on-site as scheduled, it will be postponed.</p><p>Final Exam - In the event that the final exam cannot be conducted in-person as scheduled due to the COVID-19 situation, it will be postponed to a suitable date.</p></p>

Lectures will generally be held at M-Block, Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre from 10 am. However, lecture times may vary with presenter availability. In particular, on Monday 22nd August, a double-lecture is scheduled from 10:30 am - 12:30pm at Clinipath Pathology, 310 Selby Street North, Osborne Park. A tour of the biochemistry facilities will follow these lectures.<br></p><p>Tutorials will generally run for 1-2 hours and will consist of case-based discussions, workbook exercises, and group exercises. Tutorials will be facilitated by the unit coordinator with technical support from scientific officers as required, and on occasions, with an invited expert.</p><p>On four occasions during the unit, the full allocated contact time will be spent in a laboratory working on a practical exercise (Monday 1st August; Monday 15th August; Monday 29th August; Monday 3rd October). Note that contact hours may vary on these occasions. Please refer to the up-to-date timetable and group allocations for laboratory classes.</p></p></pre></p>

Any source listed as a reference must be cited in the text. Students are required to use a consistent referencing and citation style.Established referencing and citation styles include the Vancouver, Harvard, BJP and APA styles. See the University guide for more information: <a href='https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/referencinguwa' target='_blank' >https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/referencinguwa</a>. The practice of using websites as references should be avoided in general, but trustworthy sources such as expert professional associations, expert consensus papers, etc, are appropriate. Always consider material on the internet with scepticism, as it is unlikely to have been reviewed.Do not plagiarise sources you have found using Google or similar search engines. It is quite noticeable when multiple students have used the same uncited source. Instances of plagiarism will be penalised. User-edited sources such as Wikipedia may provide a general overview, but they cannot be used to cite “facts”. These sources are consensus driven, may not be reviewed by qualified individuals, and may be subject to change over time.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>

                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
                    </ul>
