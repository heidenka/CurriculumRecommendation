It is designed to allow students to develop an advanced competency in written and spoken Indonesian, and achieve 'basic vocational proficiency' in Indonesian or Level 3 of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings, meaning they can perform effectively in most formal and informal situations. 

Materials used include short stories, magazine articles and popular videos. Students' translation skills are also enhanced. Graduates attain a relatively high level of fluency, enabling them to communicate effectively in Indonesian in social and employment contexts. Particular emphasis is placed on developing an awareness of social and cultural contexts of Indonesia using the Indonesian language. This includes broad social–cultural topics, as well as some specific focus on political contexts which are of importance to Indonesia today. To this end a wide variety of materials and language styles (genres) are explored and students are expected to explore, understand and articulate those contexts.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p><strong>UNIT DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>This unit follows on from INDO1405 Indonesian 5 and leads to INDO2407 Indonesian 7. It is designed to allow students to develop an advanced competency in written and spoken Indonesian, and achieve 'basic vocational proficiency' in Indonesian or Level 3 of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings, meaning they can perform effectively in most formal and informal situations. Materials used include short stories, magazine articles and popular videos. Students' translation skills are also enhanced. Graduates attain a relatively high level of fluency, enabling them to communicate effectively in Indonesian in social and employment contexts. </p><p>Particular emphasis is placed on developing an awareness of social and cultural contexts of Indonesia using the Indonesian language. This includes broad social-cultural topics, as well as some specific focus on political contexts which are of importance to Indonesia today. To this end a wide variety of materials and language styles (genres) are explored and students are expected to explore, understand, and articulate those contexts.</p><p>There is no formal grammatical/linguistic focus this semester, so if you have questions about how the language works (e.g. vocabulary, syntax, structures, etc.) it is up to you to ask for clarification/assistance.</p><p><strong>Social and Cultural Perspectives</strong></p><p>There is a strong emphasis in the unit on social and cultural perspectives. Each week we look at an issue in some depth and the hope is that you gain confidence not only in your language use but also in your ability to converse about important issues in Indonesian politics and society. Specific topics as listed in the Study Program represent more than two-thirds of the unit. Your focus throughout this unit should be on how the topics we consider impact the people of Indonesia.</p><p><strong>OUTCOME BASED EDUCATION STATEMENTS</strong></p><p>Indonesian 2406/3406 Indonesian 6 is designed to enable students to achieve “basic vocational proficiency” or Level 3 of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (Elaine Wylie and D. E. Ingram, Griffith University, 1995). This means that students can </p><p>1	perform effectively in a wide range of informal and formal situations pertinent to social and community life and everyday commerce and recreation, and in situations which are not linguistically demanding in their own vocational fields; students achieve 'basic vocational proficiency plus' (Level 3+) as defined by the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings; such as speaking well enough to give an unprepared speech of several minutes on familiar events or topics; use the telephone for most purposes and can generally understand the main points of most TV programs and talk shows.</p><p>2	engage in relatively complex discussions about contemporary Indonesian culture and society including popular culture and literature; there is an emphasis on oral interaction and debate in which students are encouraged to put forward a position and defend it. Also, take part in quite complex conversations on abstract things and is able to substantiate own opinions and discuss those of others.</p><p>3	deploy a wide range of formal and informal language including academic Indonesian and engage in debates about contemporary literature and film culture and adjust speech to suit a range of situations, whether formal or informal; express ideas and thoughts clearly even when the precise vocabulary may not be known by substituting others words and phrases that give a similar meaning; adjust speech to suit familiar situations with respects to formality of occasions, age of person/s with whom a conversation is being held.</p><p>4	write about Indonesian culture and society in a range of formal and informal styles as well as express and argue complex and quite complex opinions persuasively; get essential information and ideas from reading straightforward texts such as newspapers and semi-technical texts in familiar fields.</p></p></pre></p>

Prior to class most weeks you are to watch at least one video on Moodle answer vocabulary and comprehension questions about it and be prepared to discuss the material in class.  This part of the unit is one of the most demanding parts of the unit, as the language is authentic, fast and sophisticated both in content and linguistically. I will check that you have done these exercises each week and they will count towards your participation mark but they will not be handed in for correcting.</p><p>2.	In Weeks 5 &amp; 6 we will watch a feature film Long Road to Heaven which, like the interviews, is demanding. As well as considering its language, you will need to watch this film for its social &amp; political themes and style. You will be required to report on the theme of this film (see Assignment Details, below).</p><p>3.	Other audio-visual materials will be used when appropriate. </p><p><strong>Readings</strong></p><p>As well as notes and exercises, the Reader contains a variety of reading material.  Some readings have glossaries and comprehension questions; some do not.  You are required to read all materials before coming to class.  You must be prepared to discuss the topics/issues that these materials cover, and to express your considered opinion.  The content will overlap with that of other materials and you are expected to recognize and articulate these overlaps.</p><p>Each week the class covers a specific theme, such as environmental problems, the lives of women or ethnic relations in Indonesia. Students are exposed to a range of authentic audiovisual and written materials related to the topic, allowing them not only to develop listening and reading skills but also to learn in some depth about aspects of Indonesian society and culture.</p><p><strong>LMS</strong></p><p>Vocabulary lists, supplementary material and additional instructions may be provided as we go. Note that the most up to date and authoritative version of this Unit Outline, as well as necessary audio and video materials as well as links, are on the unit website which you access via www.lms.uwa.edu.au. Make sure you check your emails (at your UWA address) and LMS regularly for announcements, etc.</p></p></pre></p>

For each hour in class there is a focus on particular skills. This normally follows the following pattern:<br></p><p>Class 1: Listening and Speaking 1, on Monday 01.00 - 01.45 pm at SSCI: 161</p><p>Class 2: Listening and Speaking 2, on Tuesday 12.00 - 12.45 pm at SSCI: 161</p><p>Class 3: Reading, Writing and Translating, on Wednesday 01.00 - 01.45 pm at SSCI: 161</p><p><strong>Additional Study and Practice</strong></p><p>You should be spending at least 7 hours a week outside of class to study and practice for this unit. Take every opportunity to practice your Indonesian and to listen to it being spoken!  There are many effective learning techniques (see information on language learning strategies in Helpful Websites below).  First of all, listen to/watch as much of the material on LMS as you can. You can also listen to Indonesian radio via the internet (see Helpful Websites below) and Indonesian TV news is on SBS at 05.30 am on weekdays. Find a native speaker (there are plenty on campus!) and discuss the social, cultural and political issues with him/her. Read aloud to yourself. Varied learning methods are useful and they avoid monotony. If you are having trouble with some aspect of the language, let me know. You are welcome to come and see me during or outside consultation hours.</p><p>Prerequisites or Prior Study (If applicable) </p><p>INDO2405/INDO3405/Indonesian 5 or equivalent with the consent of the unit coordinator</p><p><strong>COURSE MATERIAL AND STUDY ACTIVITIES</strong></p><p>Indonesian 6 Course Reader for Semester 2, 2020 – available from the Co-op Bookshop.</p><p>Video material will be provided to students in class or via LMS. </p></p></pre></p>

It is an important part of the learning process. Likewise, participating in discussions is essential in demonstrating that you’ve prepared for the class. Before coming to class, make sure to read/watch/listen to the material that will be covered in class. You are also required to do various brief exercises as part of your preparation, such as vocabulary and comprehension exercises. These will not be marked but I will be checking that you have done them and they will count towards your participation mark. Effective participation in the unit requires that you devote a minimum of ten hours per week to learning activities.  These consist of three contact hours and at least seven hours of non-contact or home study.  Thus, for every class you should be doing a minimum additional two hours of study.</p><p>- In accordance with Faculty regulations, any student who does not make satisfactory progress in the course may be excluded from taking the final examination.</p><p>- A penalty of 5 per cent of the possible mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays), after which the assigned work is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due. For example, a student, who has submitted a piece of work for an assessment item late by three days and was scored a mark of 45 out of a possible mark of 50, receives after penalty a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day as a penalty for each student from the mark obtained). Where there are several tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied holistically to the assessment item after all tasks have been completed. If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course. </p><p>- Students may not submit a piece of work twice, either in the Unit or from other Units. Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p><p>All coursework students complete ACE and CARS<br></p></p></pre></p>
