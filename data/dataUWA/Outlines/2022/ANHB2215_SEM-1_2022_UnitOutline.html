This unit looks at human variation in contemporary populations from the perspective of evolutionary ecology. It focuses on ecological principles as applied to human populations, the emergence of adaptations during the process of gene-environment interaction during development, and the interplay of cultural and biological factors in human behaviour. Topics covered include principles of individual and kin selection, principles of human ecology, genetic sources of variation (beyond mutation), evolution of human development, reproductive and parental investment strategies, biological approach to culture, and evolutionary and developmental perspectives on the human life cycle.</td>

This unit looks at human variation in contemporary populations from the perspective of evolutionary ecology. It focuses on ecological principles as applied to human populations, the emergence of adaptations during the process of gene-environment interaction during development, and the interplay of cultural and biological factors in human behaviour. Topics covered include principles of individual and kin selection, principles underlying sex differences, principles of human ecology, genetic sources of variation (beyond mutation), evolution of human development, reproductive and parental investment strategies, biological approach to culture, and evolutionary and developmental perspectives on the human life cycle.</p><p>Outcomes</p><p>Students are able to (1) learn to appreciate the methods, goals and values of science and the place of evolutionary theory in the sciences; (2) appreciate the value of multidisciplinary perspectives in the biological sciences; (3) understand and clearly define questions about human evolutionary and behavioural biology and ecology, particularly the processes whereby humans adapt to their material and sociocultural environments; and (4) learn and practise critical discussion of social, economic, medical and political issues and debates from human evolutionary and ecological perspectives.</p></p></pre></p>

Students unable to travel to UWA due to travel bans participate in an online tutorial. This alternative is not otherwise available.</p><p>Tutorials are an opportunity to apply the theoretical frameworks to answer written questions, to analyze videos shown in class, and to analyze ethnographic materials (video and written).

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
