                        <p><p>In the event of more Covid-19 restrictions being imposed such as another lockdown, the unit will continue to run virtually. The students will collaborate over MS Teams and upload their progress regularly. </p><p>The collaboration in software part will continue by the group members. The hardware part ( if part of the project) will proceed by the designated group member and can be delayed if could not proceed due to lock down.This unit is taken over two semesters and parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. The project is a capstone experience in which students integrate and apply knowledge and skills acquired in earlier units to a substantial real-world design challenge relevant to their discipline. Students work in teams, typically with four to six members, and are supervised by an academic and/or industry mentor. Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project are to lead students through a systematic engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare them for professional practice as engineers. The focus of the unit is on teamwork skills and the design process.&nbsp;</p></p>

The project is a capstone experience in which students integrate and apply knowledge and skills acquired in earlier units to a substantial real-world design challenge relevant to their discipline. Students work in teams, typically with five to six members, and are supervised by an academic and/or industry mentor. Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project are to lead students through a systematic engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare them for professional practice as engineers. The focus of the unit is on teamwork skills and the design process.</p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>

You will need to come up to speed with the technologies involved in the project. You may not have the requisite experience or be familiar with the coding platform you have chosen and so you will all need to become familiar with these technologies. Remember that it is a requirement that *all* students be involved with *all* aspects of the project, though project can be divided into sub-deliverables and assign to sub-teams, but all team members must have good understanding of whole project development. A team manager may be chosen to coordinate and monitor progress of sub-teams, but during meeting with client whole group should be present.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember that you should be spending 10 hours a week on this unit and so the quantity of work should be proportional to that amount of time. Even though the deliveries relate to prototypes and documentation, if you are in a position to get started on the development of the project, you should do so.</p><p>The groups will be made by the Unit coordinator. </p><p>List of projects will be shared at the start of the semester. Groups will give their three preferences from the project list. The project will be assigned to groups by Unit Coordinator. </p><p>The groups will use MS Teams for coordination/ communication.

You are expected to meet weekly (preferably phase to phase otherwise online) with your team mates and with your client as appropriate. You should contact and meet with your client as soon as possible to enable your team to get started. The record of weekly progress will be uploaded on MS Teams on every Sunday wef week 2 of the semester as per the format shared by Unit Coordinator. Each team member needs to state explicitly what he/she contributed to the work of the team during the week. These meeting records will be viewed by the unit coordinator and will lead towards grading.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

This document can be supported by different additional measures - modeling diagrams, use cases, user stories, explicitly stated functional requirements (in the form of "the system shall"). Accompanying the functional specification will be a technical specification that will detail the technical aspects of the project.

The essay should be approximately 3,000 words. The essay topic is:</p><p>Software (and hardware) applications can have significant implications for the end users in terms of the impacts on their  individual rights such as the right to privacy and non-discrimination and the overall functioning of society. Thinking of applications such as those created by companies like Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple or Amazon discuss how the developers involved did not consider how their applications would be used and the unintended consequences of those applications on individuals and society as a whole. Should the developers have anticipated the the varied uses of their products and if so, what responsibility should they bear in those consequences? Does the  ACS Code of ethics have any relevance in the matter? Should their be laws or other regulations to stop this from happening in the future or do you think that the technology companies should simply provide a technological solution to any problems their software might cause?</p><p>The essay will be submitted over LMS (Turnitin submission).</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
