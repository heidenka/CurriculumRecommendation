                        <h3>Teaching contingency plan (In response to Covid19 restrictions)</h3>
                        <p><p>1. In the event of lockdown or stringent social distancing, face-to-face seminars and activities will be moved online and teaching will continue through Blackboard Collaborate Ultra in LMS. </p><p>2. In the event of staff absence due to COVID-related reasons, a replacement lecturer will be sought. If this is not feasible, self-directed learning materials will be provided (i.e., videos--which may include pre-recorded seminars where available, and tutorial documents). Further, as soon as staff have recovered, arrangements will be made with students to hold sessions to facilitate discussions based on the learning materials. Holding these additional sessions while continuing to deliver the regularly scheduled lectures (i.e., multiple meetings in a single week) will be considered as the first possibility, as this avoids going past week 12 of semester and final grades being delayed. However, if this is not possible, the lectures will be pushed back and delivered after week 12 of semester. We appreciate that this is not ideal, and see this as a temporary measure put in place to handle this extraordinary circumstance. Thank you for your understanding and patience as we try to bring you the best educational experience that we are able to.</p><p>3. If you contract COVID, or have to self-isolate, all unit content will be made available to you online in LMS. If extensions to assessment deadlines are required, then UWA special consideration policies will apply.</p><p>4. Any changes to teaching activities will be announced in LMS. Make sure to check your student email account to receive these announcements.</p></p>

The skills they learn in the unit are likely to supplement the skills they develop when they undertake their research thesis later in their course, and enable them to tackle research questions as they arise in their future careers. Essentially, the unit is designed to help students to (1) understand the value of research undertaken in organisational settings; (2) develop an understanding of  key organisational research methods; and (3) learn how to present research in organisational settings.</td>

We pay our respects to their Elders both past and present.</p><p><strong>Welcome to Research Methods in Applied Settings!</strong></p><p>Most organisational research boils down to the following tasks:&nbsp;</p><p>(a) measure something (as reliably and validly as possible,&nbsp;</p><p>(b) predict something (and explain why),&nbsp;</p><p>(c) change something (for the better), and&nbsp;</p><p>(d) evaluate the change.&nbsp;</p><p>The above are generally sufficient to cover most of the research studies that you will undertake in your degree, and indeed any psychology program at this University. What you measure, predict, change, or evaluate ought to be premised on a research question. Identifying what is a good research question and translating that question into a research project is a lot more difficult than it sounds! The assessments are designed to help you make the links between the research methods that are taught and how they can be applied to develop and implement research projects in applied settings. In this unit, you will be introduced to a range of specific research techniques, including methodology, research design and analytic procedures, which will be of value both to your research and applied practice (e.g., placements)</p></p></pre></p>

It is expected that you will be actively involved in class activities and discussions and will prepare for class by doing the assigned pre-work as specified on LMS. It is the responsibility of all students to contribute to the learning environment of the unit.</p><p>Master of Industrial and Organisational Psychology (MIOP) students, please note that the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) requires that <strong>students enrolled in an APAC accredited program (which MIOP is) </strong>undertake sufficient training to offer the opportunity for them to achieve the required skills and competences. It is <strong>compulsory</strong> that <strong>students enrolled in an APAC accredited program be punctual and attend all coursework and other specified training activities</strong> unless extenuating circumstances (such as illness or significant personal crisis) prevent them from doing so. Where students cannot attend (or have not attended) the full required activities or classes, they are expected to notify the unit coordinator to provide an adequate explanation and documentation (such as a medical certificate in the event of illness) explaining their absence or lateness. A failure to attend without adequate explanation and documented evidence of illness or other impeding factors beyond one’s personal control will result in failing the unit in which the class/activity was missed. Note that even where an adequate explanation and documented evidence are supplied, a student will still fail the unit if he/she has not attended a sufficient proportion of the coursework unit (i.e., at least 80% of the unit). If absences or lateness are numerous or prolonged, the student will be directed at the discretion of the unit coordinator to discuss with the Program Director to make a plan to address the issue(s). Given the current UWA Health Advice to stay home if unwell for any reason, for 2022 a minimum of 75% attendance in every coursework unit will be applied in consideration of the extraordinary circumstance in which we are now living. This will be re-reviewed for 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

You must, however, responsibly references any source on which you draw, and must provide sufficient detail that a reader could access that source (e.g., web link; title, author, and edition of book, etc.). It is up to you (or your group) how you want to provide these references.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For the technical report section of the individual research report</strong>, please adhere to the academic referencing style as recommended by the American Psychological Association. See the UWA library guide for some guidance: <a href='https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/apa' target='_blank' >https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/apa</a>.

If this is not feasible, self-directed learning materials will be provided (i.e., videos--which may include pre-recorded seminars where available, and tutorial documents). Further, as soon as staff have recovered, arrangements will be made with students to hold sessions to facilitate discussions based on the learning materials. Holding these additional sessions while continuing to deliver the regularly scheduled lectures (i.e., multiple meetings in a single week) will be considered as the first possibility, as this avoids going past week 12 of semester and final grades being delayed. However, if this is not possible, the lectures will be pushed back and delivered after week 12 of semester. We appreciate that this is not ideal, and see this as a temporary measure put in place to handle this extraordinary circumstance. Thank you for your understanding and patience as we try to bring you the best educational experience that we are able to.</p></pre></p><br />

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
