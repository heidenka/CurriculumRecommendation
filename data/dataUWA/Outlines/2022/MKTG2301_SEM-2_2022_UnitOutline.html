                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p><strong>Welcome to Small Business Management. </strong>Small firms (SME) comprise the majority of all businesses in the economies of most countries. In Australia, these comprise around 96 percent of all the non-agricultural firms in existence. The majority of such firms are very small (micro-enterprises) with less than five employees, usually just a single owner-manager (nano-enterprise). The reality of business management within a small firm is substantially different from that found in the majority of large organizations.&nbsp;</p><p>As the name suggests, owner-managers are both owners and therefore responsible for all the risks associated with their business venture. Such individuals must deal with all the functional tasks of business management (e.g. accounting, planning, marketing, human resources, production, and information technology) frequently without much assistance and with limited training. The average small business owner-manager world is quite different from that of the professional manager within a large organization, or even the successful entrepreneur. </p><p>This unit is multidisciplinary in nature. It draws together theories and concepts from the areas of entrepreneurship, leadership, organizational strategy, financing, marketing, and human resources management. Furthermore, the unit will not assume extensive prior knowledge in any of these fields, but it is designed to cover relevant theoretical principles and frameworks and apply these in real-life cases.&nbsp;</p><p><i><u>Case studies (problem-solving) and team-based learning will be key components of the curriculum that aims to equip students with higher-order skills, which are often in demand in today's workplace.</u></i></p><p><strong>UNIT CONTENT</strong></p><p>The unit will be delivered around four core modules and themes as follows:</p><p><strong>Module 1: New business creation</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><i>The characteristics of entrepreneurs vs owner-managers, new business creation models, success and failure in business start-ups, screening new venture opportunities, financing the business.</i></p><p><strong>Module 2: Growth in the small firm</strong></p><p><i>The process of planning and strategy in the small firm, marketing in the small firm, the process of growth in the small firm, managing people in the small business.</i><br></p><p><strong>Module 3: Small firms and family business</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><i>There are differences between family/non-family firms, managing and succession planning in the family business, other types of small firms, small firms, and the co-operative business model.</i></p><p><strong>Module 4: The troubled company&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><i>The causes and signals of failure, principles of re-engineering, turnaround strategies, and solving problems.</i></span></p><p><strong>UNIT GOALS</strong><br></p><p>The principal aim of this unit is to familiarise students with the knowledge and practice of effective small business management. It will challenge assumptions that may be held about the way small businesses can or should adopt large business models and management practices. <b style="">For students interested in establishing and managing their own small business,</strong> this unit should help to focus thinking on the realities of life as a small business owner-manager with both its demands and the rewards. <strong>For students that are keen to make a difference</strong>, this unit should enable them to understand how they might consult with small firms and assist owner-managers to establish and grow their businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>Students with a range of other interests will also benefit from the course. Managers in large corporations and financial institutions often deal with small businesses as clients or suppliers. Professionals such as accountants, lawyers, and consultants provide advice and other services to small businesses. Government officials devise and implement policies, regulations, and support programs that will affect the small business sector. A good understanding of effective small business management can assist such individuals in their work.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p><strong>I encourage you to develop an attitude to acquiring a deep understanding of business knowledge through problem-based learning.</strong>&nbsp;This is achieved by using case studies and building on your opportunities for collaboration in group work. Group work facilitates greater learning than each student would achieve individually. This can initially be more challenging because we are all accustomed to passive learning, memorizing things, and reproducing text.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>However, problem-based learning is far more active and with conscious effort and practice, will gradually become a more engaging and fulfilling way to learn and recall what you have learned.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You will progressively enhance your ability to use reflection and integration and apply your knowledge in various real-life contexts. Short videos and guest lecturers, wherever possible, aim to further enrich this type of learning experience.</p><p><strong>Teaching and Learning Evaluation</strong></p><p>You will be asked to complete an evaluation of your learning. The traditional SPOT and SURF evaluation has been merged into one document This is completed online and is a university-wide survey that deals with the student aspects of learning whether this is the teaching or the unit content. You will receive an email from the SURVEY Office inviting you to complete the evaluation when it is activated.&nbsp;</p><p>We encourage you to complete the forms as your feedback is extremely important and can be used to make changes to the unit or lecturing style when appropriate. This feedback is very valuable, is accepted without prejudice, and has been instrumental in improving teaching and learning in this unit.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
