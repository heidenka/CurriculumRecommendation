Students will compare and contrast healthcare systems and their components, examining the issues and complexities faced, as well as examining best practice examples. Through this comparative analysis of health system attributes and outcomes students will debate the main models and principles of health systems, including public vs private healthcare.

The second component of this unit will enhance students understanding of both local and global health policy through the application of concepts, theories and methods for common issues facing the health sector.  Students will critical analyse common national and international healthcare policy challenges, learn different methodologies for policy development and reform in complex environments and be able to critique policy at a level appropriate for a healthcare leader. 

The third component of this unit focuses on clinical and corporate governance. Students will analyse common governance issues facing healthcare organisations, examine governance models and standards and learn tools and techniques to develop and implement strategies aimed at improving the quality of healthcare organisations. Students will learn strategies aimed at reducing harm, improving consumer engagement and improving the safety and efficiency of healthcare systems and processes through quality improvements tools and techniques.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p><strong>Unit Content</strong></p><p>This unit takes a general perspective and is concerned with setting the nation’s future policy direction and its impact on healthcare organisations. The most important outcome from undertaking this unit is learning about the changes taking place in the healthcare environment; how healthcare managers/leaders can think and act appropriately. </p><p>The unit provides you with policy-related theoretical concepts and their applications to improve students’ thinking capabilities.  Several topics are considered:  What is healthcare? What is public health? What is the policy impact on healthcare organisations? How do policy development and reforms happen within the healthcare sector?  How is healthcare financed? The role of universal public health insurance (Medicare) and private health insurance.</p><p><strong>The Goal of the unit</strong></p><p>The most important outcome is that you are able to think about the complexities surrounding the healthcare organisations and act strategically.  Overall, the course aims to improve healthcare policy management and healthcare organisations’ practice, i.e., your ability to manage a variety of policy and governance situations within the healthcare settings.  These situations may be complicated, and you should be able to cope with a considerable amount of ambiguity, including the constant shifting of policies.  The aim of the course is to introduce students to:</p><p>•	The importance of stakeholders and how they interact and shape the healthcare system of the nation.</p><p>•	Formulation and implementation of public health policies and their implications on healthcare organisations.</p><p>•	Analysis of various healthcare services, including primary healthcare system, acute-care system, and the allied healthcare sector. </p><p>•	Understanding healthcare financing, tax-based universal health insurance (Medicare), private health insurance, and other sources.</p><p>•	The roles of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in the health system.</p><p>•	The role and responsibilities of various levels of governments in the implementation of policies and management of healthcare delivery.</p><p>•	The importance of clinical governance: quality, safety and access to healthcare.</p><p>•	Able to understand the digitisation of the healthcare system and value creation, including electronic medical records, and the changes taking place in access to physicians and specialists.</p><p>•	Comparative health systems among a few selected countries.</p><p>•	Aspects of healthcare leadership at top levels of the organisation.</p><p>The unit perspective is that of the entire organisation/department, usually seen from the position of a general manager/clinical-business manager, policy director, health department manager and/or managing director/CEO. However, the topic is also of interest to all levels of management; physicians, nurses, policymakers, and staff and advisers. These people are affected by and influence the way healthcare providers deliver cost-effective healthcare services.  </p><p>With a more active approach, you will learn far more than a few theories and interesting statistics, and this will serve you well in understanding the healthcare system of the nation and its policies and governance.  Therefore, you must pre-read and prepare well for seminar sessions, attend and participate actively in those sessions, hand in assignments on time, and do your fair share of work in team/group projects.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

Therefore, students must prepare and read the relevant concepts, textbook chapters, and articles assigned before the seminar. </p><p>The study pack has been designed to facilitate learning that includes the reading package with relevant journal articles and textbook chapters related to the healthcare system.</p><p>Students are encouraged to share their (or their colleagues/friends) healthcare business experiences and successful and/or not so successful strategies in the classroom.  Students will have frequent opportunities to work as individuals and in groups to apply their understanding of concepts while developing their assignments.</p><p><strong>ASSESSMENT MECHANISM</strong></p><p><strong>The purpose of the assessment</strong></p><p>There are many reasons for having assessable tasks as part of an academic program. The assessable tasks are designed to encourage you to explore and understand the subject more fully. The fact that we grade your work provides you with an indication of how much you have achieved. Providing feedback on your work also serves as part of the learning process.</p><p>Assignment-1: Class participation (see assessment item section).</p><p>Assignment-2: Individual learning journal/diary (see assessment item section).</p><p>Assignment-3: Team/Group project report: 3a) The individual part	and 3b) The team part&nbsp; (see assessment item section).</p></p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Unit Structure</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>The course lends itself to analysis and discussions of health policies as well as theoretical concepts. An essential feature of the course is an emphasis on perspective and developing one's own point of view.  </p><p>Students expected to spend an average of 6-8 hours individually and in their groups preparing for each class session.  <u>Successful learning depends very much on reading the material, adequate preparation and having a constructive discussion of issues in your groups and the class</u>.  To paraphrase Frances Bacon: <strong>“reading makes a person full, writing makes a person precise, and debate makes a person prepared.”</strong></p><p>You will have to deal with quite many different ideas – sometimes they agree with each other, sometimes they don’t.  You will be given concepts/frameworks and support to help you integrate the different perspectives you will encounter. It is also essential that you exercise your mind to make sense of or accept these differences in your way so that you develop your own thinking and views.</p><p>This course uses a variety of learning methods, including theoretical concepts, classroom and group discussions of both theory and practical application, and knowledge gained from guest lecturers who are active in the healthcare sector. Therefore, attendance and participation in class sessions are an essential part of the learning process and the functioning of the course.</p><p>The course consists of 12 sessions; each session is about 3.0 hours. The unit structure consists of:</p><p>1)	A selection of a few journal articles/readings supplement to the textbook,</p><p>2)	A collection of essential concepts/theories from the textbook chapters, and</p><p>3)	Guest speakers from the healthcare industry.</p><p>On completion of this unit, you should be able to:</p><p>•	Have a deeper understanding of healthcare policy and the importance of stakeholders in shaping the nation’s healthcare system.</p><p>•	Have a deeper understanding of the funding system for healthcare.</p><p>•	Have a clear understanding of the governance structure of the healthcare system.</p><p>•	Have experience in applying theory/concepts and your work experience to several policy issues and readings.</p><p><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></p><p>A critical task is to identify which questions to ask rather than to seek answers to questions put by someone else. Throughout the course, in-class discussion of policies, deciding on topics for assignments, and evaluating theoretical concepts, students must frame their questions wherever possible.  In this unit, you will be provided with the opportunity to:</p><p>1).	Critically evaluate the issues that the healthcare system is facing.</p><p>2).	Understand the healthcare system, including the importance of stakeholders, policies and competitive threats that the providers experience.</p><p>3).	Demonstrate effective communication skills to influence and relate to multiple stakeholders across a range of business contexts.</p><p>4).	Develop competencies to work more effectively in teams by completing a group/team project relating to your selected topics.</p><p>5).	Apply research skills to investigate current and future issues confronting healthcare organisations.</p></p></pre></p>

More formally, the University regulations state that ‘to complete a course or unit, students shall attend prescribed classes, lectures, seminars and tutorials. However, a student cannot participate in a scheduled class due to exceptional circumstances, and they must obtain prior approval from the unit coordinator to be absent from that class. Any student absent from class without having had such absence approved by the unit coordinator may be referred to the faculty for advice and may be required to withdraw from the unit.</p></p></pre></p>

The Harvard style is preferred unless otherwise stated by the unit coordinator. There are some notes for guidance that the library staff has prepared: ‘Citing your Sources Harvard Style’. The EndNote software package is a really good system for building up a database of references. Not everyone will want to invest the time in using this system, but you should consider it if you intend to build up resource materials or plan to undertake extensive research in a particular area. The library staff have also developed a tutoring package: ‘A Quick Guide to Using EndNote’ which provides the basics for using EndNote with an essay <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote' target='_blank' >http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote</a> Acknowledging Sources of Information and the Business School Policy on Plagiarism: Student Services provides an online plagiarism portal that includes a definition of plagiarism and a link to FAQ www.studentservices.uwa.edu.au/ss/learning/online_services/plagiarism_portal ‘Turnitin' Originality Checking and Plagiarism Prevention is used in the Faculty to allow both educators and their students check written work for improper citation or misappropriated content.

The assessable tasks are designed to encourage you to explore and understand the subject more fully. The fact that we grade your work provides you with an indication of how much you have achieved. Providing feedback on your work also serves as part of the learning process.</p><p><u>Assessment mechanism summary</u></p><p><strong><i>Assignment-1: Class participation</i>.</strong></p><p>Class participation On-going Students are NOT allowed to miss more than two (2) sessions during the term unless they present adequate documentary evidence to justify their absence.</p><p>Healthcare Systems, Policy and Governance is as much about healthcare and public policy perspective. Therefore, attendance and participation in-class activities and discussions are essential in developing these abilities. Thus, the marks are awarded after considering the following:</p><p>•	Attendance means arriving and leaving the class on time.  Please inform us if you have a valid reason for missing a class.  If you miss a class, you will be required to prepare notes to show that you have undertaken the preparation.</p><p>•	Class participation, whether listening to a lecture or getting involved in other activities, is an integral part of the learning process.  It is, therefore, important that you attend classes (and be on time).</p><p>Participation in discussions is harder to measure but essential to this unit.  While minimum participation in discussion is required, we have a broad view of participation, including evidence of prior preparation, alertness and following the flow of class discussions, active and naturally effective participation in syndicates and class discussions (a thoughtful comment based on good preparation and judgement is worth much more than superficial remarks).</p><p>Two or more missed classes without prior permission from the lecturer is classified as unsatisfactory.  Students should not expect to obtain approval to miss more than six hours of class time per unit unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p><p>More formally, the University regulations state that ‘to complete a course or unit a student shall attend prescribed classes, lectures seminars and tutorials.  Students whose unsatisfactory attendance at MBA units will not be granted a passing grade.</p><p>Students are allocated a week to present their understanding of the topic for 10-minutes. They need to present the topic of the week to the class.<br></p><p><i><strong>Assignment-2: Individual learning journal/diary</strong></i><br></p><p>You are required to keep and maintain an ongoing learning journal/diary that captures your reflective learning process throughout this unit.  The assignment will ensure that you will be an active participant and help you apply your knowledge and experiences, particularly when reflecting upon the materials.</p><p>Within your Learning Journal / Diary, you need to identify (at least) <strong><u>12 key lessons</u></strong> learnt from the unit, including your rationale for choosing each of them. For example, your Learning Journal / Diary might include: </p><p>1)	Key learning points from the journal articles, textbook chapters, guest speakers and videos, etc.</p><p>2)	How might you have applied the healthcare and public policy models/ frameworks/theory during your past work experience?  How might you apply them currently?  How could you use them in the future?</p><p>3)	What evidence of sound policy development and implementation practice have you observed in your work?  What was not managed well?  Why not?  How might you have handled the situation differently?</p><p>4)	In what way you would have applied innovative policy-making and implementation process, and what impact it will have on the performance of the organisation or public policy department.</p><p>5)	What changes you might anticipate in health care delivery in the future? And how do these changes disrupt the current policies?</p><p>Do note that the Learning journal/diary is meant to capture your learning process. Therefore, it has to be far more than just a re-presentation of student comments made during a class discussion.  In-depth analysis and reflective thinking are required relating to you as a health care leader – past, present and future.</p><p>This assignment will be assessed according to several criteria such as depth of analysis, healthcare insight; quality reflective thinking; the ability of the student to relate course materials to their role as a manager of a healthcare organisation.</p><p>The maximum word length for the Learning Journal / Diary is 20 typed pages.  These page limits do not include tables or figures, or appendices.  You can write/present this assignment in any format/structure you prefer.  It is expected that a very high-quality piece of work needs to be produced for an assignment of this nature.  The submission format should be 12 pt fonts with 1.5 lines spacing.  More than the maximum limit of pages suggested above will be penalised 5% per page in excess.  Refer to the word limit and late submission penalties in section "Submission of assignments" below.</p><p><strong><i>Assignment-3a: Individual Policy Analysis Paper</i></strong><br></p><p>See individual part of the team project.</p><p><strong><i>Assignment-3b: Team/Group project report:</i></strong></p><p>The purpose of this assignment is for you to learn to analyse how policy-making happens in practice.  Furthermore, the assignment calls for you to compare different policy areas, evaluate the similarities and differences, and gain an overall perspective of policy issues. Finally, you will be encouraged to use the policy models and concepts from the course to see how and if they fit and which ones best explain policy-making in different contexts and policy areas.</p><p>Each Group will comprise 3 or 4 students and submit a written report, including an individual and a group component.  The report must have 3-sections:</p><p>Section 1 must include a thorough executive summary, on one page, accurately summarising all the key points of the report – a “report on a page” – and any background or introduction as necessary.</p><p>Section 2 – Individual assignment – will contain an analysis of the policy-making process of each group member’s current or previous policy area. The individual group member must carry out each individual report. The Individual reports should be about five pages long, but it still is to be thorough and comprehensive. It should be an exercise in the skills of providing extensive and relevant information in a short space.</p><p>Prepare an individual part on a selected topic of your choice in determining the effective policy-making and the implementation currently being used in terms of population health and/or health care.</p><p>The key to receiving high marks for this assignment is the analysis you present regarding the important policy issues facing the health system and its implications for healthcare firms.</p><p>Your assignment should use academic policy frameworks/models and include references from readings and the textbook. The report shall not be more than 2,500 words (excluding abstract, the reference list, exhibits and annexes) and should be typed using 1.5 or double spacing with reasonable side margins.</p><p>Section 3 – Group Assignment – will be a Group interpretation and evaluation of the different policy areas, as if you were a consultant analysing how different policy-making are carried out, and developing insights into the policy-making process.  The issue you might address include but are not limited to: How do they compare? What similarities and/or differences in processes were there? What did this tell you about policy-making? Why did different policy areas adopt different approaches? How far do you think the differences described were due to the perspective and/or methodology used by the person analysing and developing the policy? Again, this should be the result of the team’s interpretation, not just that of one individual.  It should be around 3,000 words.<br></p><p>Notes:<br></p><p>Note 1: Results may be subject to scaling and standardisation under faculty policy and are not necessarily the sum of the component parts.</p><p>Note 2: The grade FC indicates a failure to complete an identified essential assessment component and means a failure of the unit.</p><p>Note 3: Your assessed work may also be used for quality assurance purposes, such as to assess the level of achievement of learning outcomes as required for accreditation and audit purposes. The findings may be used to inform changes aimed at improving the quality of Business School programs. All material used for such processes will be treated as confidential, and the outcome will not affect your grade for the unit.</p><p>Late submission of Assignments<br></p><p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p><p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p><p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p><p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p><p>Penalty for exceeding word limit</p><p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p><p>Academic conduct</p><p>Academic Integrity is defined in the University Policy on Academic Conduct as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p><p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to the seriousness of the case and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other awards to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p><p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding academic conduct and ethical scholarship at UWA.</p><p>Special Considerations</p><p>If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:</p><p>serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend serious injury being a victim of a crime breakdown of relationship sudden loss of income or employment serious disruption to domestic arrangements The full policy and information on applying for special consideration are available at <a href='http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/course/exams/consideration' target='_blank' >http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/course/exams/consideration</a>.</p><p>Review and Appeal of Academic Decisions Relating to Students</p><p>The full regulations governing appeal, and the process procedures are available on the Governance website.</p><p>Compulsory online modules</p><p>UWA has a wealth of resources available to support your student learning.
