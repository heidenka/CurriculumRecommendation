The presentation should take the form of a microteaching lesson given to your peers about a useful digital tool, demonstrating how to use it technologically and explaining how to use it pedagogically, embedded within at least two distinct secondary subject areas, and accompanied by a 500-word reflective statement.&nbsp;This task relates to your ability to help your students develop ICT/digital literacy skills, as per the ICT General Capability/Digital Literacy Capability.</p><p>Task: You will work in a group with 4-5 members, ideally with different major subject areas. Begin by choosing one digital tool or platform other than those covered in the Practice/Tools sessions of your tutorials as indicated on p.15 of this Unit Guide (note: you will find many ideas on the Digital Learning website at <a href='https://goo.gl/G3BNjx' target='_blank' >https://goo.gl/G3BNjx</a>), and confirm with your tutor that it is an appropriate choice. Then nominate your group for one of the timetabled group presentation sessions. In your 15-minute presentation, you should:</p><p>•	demonstrate to peers how to use the tool (consider allowing peers to try it out by following your instructions)</p><p>•	explain how to implement the tool pedagogically with reference to at least two distinct secondary subject areas (indicating the appropriate year level/s in each case)</p><p>•	outline any legal, ethical, technological or pedagogical issues which might arise with use of the tool and how to deal with them</p><p>•	conclude by reinforcing the concept behind your presentation (answer the question ‘so what?’, emphasising the educational value of the tool)</p><p>Your presentation may be face-to-face/in person or online. In either case, group members must be present to respond to questions and comments.</p><p>While your peers watch your presentation, they will note down questions and feedback on a peer review form. There will be 5 minutes of questions and comments at the end of each presentation, after which written feedback will be passed to group members.</p><p>Once your session is finished, you should debrief as a group. You should write a 500-word reflective statement as a group, very briefly summarising your key points, reflecting on how well your presentation worked and any changes you would make for a future presentation, and drawing on feedback and/or questions received from your peers and tutors. The reflective statement is due for submission one week after your presentation.</p><p><strong>Task 2: Mini-E-portfolio</strong></p><p>(Task links to APST Standards 2, 3 4 &amp; 6/7)<br></p><p>Key focus: You will construct a 4-page mini-e-portfolio demonstrating your ability to use ICTs in effective ways to support your teaching, your students’ learning, and your own learning (through your PLN). This task relates to your achievement of at least the Graduate Level of the ICT-related focus areas in the APST, as well as the establishment of a PLN (personal learning network) linked to a focus area from Standard 6 or Standard 7.&nbsp;This task relates to your achievement of at least the Graduate Level of the ICT-related focus areas in the APST, as well as the establishment of a PLN (personal learning network) linked to a focus area from Standard 6 or Standard 7.<br></p><p><strong>Task 2A: Mini-E-portfolio Focus Areas 2.6, 3.4 &amp; 4.5 (40%)</strong></p><p>(APST Standards 2, 3 &amp; 4)</p><p>Key focus: You will construct a 4-page mini-e-portfolio demonstrating your ability to use ICTs in effective ways to support your teaching, your students’ learning, and your own learning (through your PLN).</p><p>Task 2A: You may construct your e-portfolio on any digital platform of your choice (e.g., a website such a Weebly or Wix, a blog such as Edublogs, a wiki such as PBWorks, etc); you may wish to confirm the appropriacy of your choice with your tutor before commencing work. Whichever platform you choose, please ensure it is protected with a strong password; when submitting your work, you should give your tutor access by means of a guest password.</p><p>In the first part of this task, you will construct a webpage (one page of your e-portfolio) for each of the following three ICT-related Focus Areas: Focus Area 2.6 (Information and Communication Technology), Focus Area 3.4 (Select and use resources), and Focus Area 4.5 (Use ICT safely, responsibly and ethically). In each case you should demonstrate your accomplishment of at least the Graduate Level of the Focus Area. For each Focus Area, you should: </p><p>•	briefly show your knowledge of relevant theory, critical literature and/or curriculum documents (ensure you reference and, if possible, link to these resources)</p><p>•	describe examples of your accomplishment in text</p><p>•	provide evidence of your accomplishment in text and/or through supporting multimodal artefacts (ensure that you always explain how your examples show your attainment of the Standards – the ultimate aim on each page is to show the ways in which your approach to teaching has benefited or will benefit your students’ learning; note that you may complement your statements about what you have already done with ICTs with statements about how, in light of this unit, you would enhance your use of ICTs, or implement ICTs for the first time in tasks where you have not previously used them)</p><p>You may write up to 500 words per Focus Area, and can include as many multimodal artefacts as you wish (though beware of overpowering your text with too many images, videos or widgets).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Task 2B: Mini-E-portfolio PLN (20%)</strong><br></p><p>(APST Standards 6 &amp; 7)<br></p><p>Task 2B: In the second part of this task, you will construct a webpage (one page of your e-portfolio) connected to a relevant Focus Area of either Standard 6 or Standard 7, where you will present your PLN. You should include:</p><p>•	a visualisation (e.g., a mindmap) of your PLN, which should include links to both people and resources, and should incorporate face-to-face contacts and analogue resources alongside digital resources; it is recommended that you include professional organisations such as AATE, ALEA and/or MAWA (consider annotating your visualisation with additional information pertaining to the bullet points below; note that annotations which are part of your visualisation are not included in the overall word count)</p><p>•	a brief description of the nature and purpose of a PLN</p><p>•	a brief description of how your PLN is linked to the Focus Area you have chosen</p><p>•	a description of your PLN, where you explain:</p><p>o	how you created it</p><p>o	how it has impacted your learning</p><p>o	how it has impacted your classroom practice and your students’ learning</p><p>o	how you have used it to contribute to the learning of your peers/colleagues</p><p>o	how this may have impacted their classroom practice and their students’ learning</p><p>o	how you plan to consolidate and expand it in the future</p><p>You may write up to 500 words in addition to your PLN visualisation/annotations, and you can include as many supplementary  multimodal  artefacts as you wish.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
