                        <p><p>If you take a COVID test and are required to self-isolate, you should not attend class in person until you have received a negative test result. Please contact Kate if that's the case so you can be allocated to an online tutorial for the duration of your isolation. In the event of future COVID-19 restrictions preventing face-to-face classes, all lectures and tutorials will be delivered online for the relevant period.</p><p>COVID PROTOCOLS</p><p>The Law School has developed protocols to deal with those instances where a student has been in a lecture or tutorial and, following the class, is required to isolate and undergo a COVID test under Government guidelines.</p><p>1. The student is expected to inform their Unit Coordinator/tutor/lecturer that they are undergoing a COVID test for any reason - they are symptomatic, are a close contact, were at an exposure site, etc.</p><p>2. All other students/staff that were present in that class will be informed of this fact, ensuring the student's/ identity and circumstances are kept confidential.</p><p>3. Under current Government guidelines the other students/staff are not required to isolate or be tested but they may wish to do so.</p><p>4. The student is expected to inform their Unit Coordinator/tutor/lecturer of the outcome of the test who will in turn inform others in the class.</p><p>5. If the student tests positive, all members of the class must follow government guidelines regarding testing and isolation.</p></p>

The vast majority of people are unaware of the many legal issues that can impact on everyday lives.This unit will introduce students to some of the most fundamental legal concepts as well as providing practical guidance in navigating legal issues that can be encountered on a day to day basis. Covering all major aspects of a person's life, such as working, consuming, renting and using the internet, this unit will be particularly useful to those students new to adulthood.

The unit will provide an introduction to the law, including the nature and role of law, sources and the court system before moving on to a consideration of  core legal concepts, such as Criminal Law, Torts and Contract. These core concepts will be interspersed with practical topics, examining how these central legal principles may arise in a real world context. These practical topics will include driving, working, housing, medical care, and purchasing goods and services, as well as how to advocate for change in the law.</td>

The vast majority of people are unaware of the many legal issues that can impact on everyday lives. This unit introduces students to some of the most fundamental legal concepts as well as providing practical guidance in navigating legal issues that can be encountered on a day to day basis. Covering major aspects of a person's life, this unit will be particularly useful to those students new to adulthood. The unit will provide an introduction to the law, including the nature and role of law, sources and the court system before moving on to a consideration of core legal concepts, such as Criminal Law, Torts and Contract. These core concepts will be interspersed with practical topics, examining how these central legal principles may arise in a real world context. These practical topics will include driving, working, housing, medical care, and purchasing goods and services, as well as how to advocate for change in the law.</p><p><u>There is no textbook for this unit. All the information and resources you need are online and linked in each LMS topic folder.&nbsp;</u></p><p><u><strong>Please note that teaching staff cannot give legal advice. If you have a specific legal issue, you should seek advice from Legal Aid WA or a community legal centre. (Information on these organisations can be found in LMS under the 'Helpful Online Resources and Information' tab).</strong></u><br></p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content.

Please note: <u>the tutorials start in <strong>WEEK 3</strong> of semester.</u>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Lectures</u>: </strong>Attendance at the lecture is not compulsory but is very much encouraged. In the lecture, Kate will deliver content but it is also an opportunity for you to ask questions about specific issues to do with law that you are curious about. Also note that you will have an opportunity to determine the content of the lectures throughout semester.&nbsp;</p><p><u style="font-weight: bold;">Tutorials:&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>You should prepare for each week's tutorials by attending the lecture (or listening to it online), reading the tutorial questions and reading the recommended reading material on LMS. You should already be allocated to a tutorial through the CAS system and can change your own class allocations up to the end of Week 2 of semester (subject to availability) on CAS (cas.uwa.edu.au). After that time, if you need to change tutorials, please address queries to Kate Offer, the Unit Coordinator.  It is important that seminar sizes remain consistent and so you should stay in your allocated class for the duration of semester. In cases of sickness or other emergencies, and you can't attend your tutorial for one week, you may attend a make up tutorial for THAT WEEK ONLY and as long as you have contacted your tutor and there is space in the venue.  An alternative time may be suggested if space constraints exist.&nbsp;</p><p><u>For information about the tutorial times and venues for this unit, please see the Timetables website (timetables.uwa.edu.au).</u></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
