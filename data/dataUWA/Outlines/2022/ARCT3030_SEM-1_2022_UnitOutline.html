                                    <td>This unit is the culmination of the technology sequence in the Architecture major. As such, it is thought of as an extension and further development of ARCT2030 Materials and Small Constructions. Through a similarly analytical methodology it introduces students to construction techniques of greater complexity, with an emphasis on architecture as an integrated manifestation of structure, body, skin and building services. 

Topics include architectural and structural analysis, materials and sections; fire services and safety; hydraulic, mechanical, and electrical systems, and the types and applicability of constructional systems to different architectural expressions. 

The unit generates an understanding of the integration of structures and services in medium- to large-scale buildings. The vehicle for this is the combined effect of weekly lectures and workshops. Lectures investigate and critically analyse a number of selected buildings highlighting architectural, structural and technical aspects that pertain to different materials and construction techniques. They also illustrate specialist drawings produced by consultants, including structures and services. In the workshops students conduct an analysis of selected buildings, to identify the relationships between architecture, space, structure and technology. Such analysis evolves weekly through progressive reviews with a tutor at each workshop and it culminates in two submissions during the semester.</td>

Lectures are a fundamental part of this unit, where significant content is delivered and critical information will be shared.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>TUTORIALS</strong><br></p><p>Here students will progressively review their work towards the production of their A1 Drawing for both Submission A and B. Students will arrive at the Tutorial with a printed version of the in-progress A1 and pin it onto the wall. The Tutor will then&nbsp; review all drawings in a collective manner, so that discussion and peer-learning can take place in each session.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>SUBMISSIONS</strong></p><p>Submission A : 2D analysis of a selected building focusing on a significant structural bay;</p><p>Submission B : 3D analysis of a selected building focusing on a significant structural bay;</p><p>Each of the two submissions consists of one digital A1 in PDF format (to be uploaded on LMS by the due date) which displays a graphical analysis of the selected building. </p><p>A template for both Submissions can be found on LMS/ Content &amp; References and should be followed in great detail. </p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>EXAMPLES OF PREVIOUS SUBMISSIONS</strong></p><p>Previous Example of both submissions A and B will be shown at the first lecture and will be made available to students in hard copy during Tutorials and on LMS in the Content &amp; References section. </p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>UNIT WORK FLOW and PROCESS toward SUBMISSIONS A and B </strong></p><p><strong>WEEK 1</strong></p><p>- Select two or three medium to large building from the list of recommended Architects (see below); </p><p>- Confirm your building selection with Tutor at the first tutorial (see Unit Timetable); </p><p>- Review examples of previous work on LMS and familiarise with the Submission A template, also on LMS.</p><p><strong>FOLLOWING WEEKS up to SUBMISSION A</strong></p><p>- Research and read extensively about architectural and technical aspects of the selected buildings and review all relevant research with Tutor; </p><p>- Compile your research into an A4 booklet / file to take with you at every Tutorial;</p><p>- Produce a Draft A1 as per Submission A template on LMS to pin up and review at the Tutorial each week;</p><p>- The Draft A1 will have a scale ranging to 1:40 to 1:20 and it will be a "sliced-off" 2D drawing (Refer to Examples of Previous Submissions)</p><p>- Investigate and highlight the structural pattern of the entire building in plan and section;</p><p>- Re-draw a meaningful structural bay and relevant surrounding area (ie: including facade or wall separating inside from outside);</p><p>- Investigate the details and connections of all elements (structure, services, finishes, materials etc.) and re-draw these in detail in plan, section and elevation;</p><p>- This A1 should be a clearly readable highly detailed line-drawing displaying textures, shadows and material qualities of the selected building.</p><p>- The A1 should include carefully edited and aligned labels providing concise technical description of each component of the building.</p><p>- Finalize the Two-dimensional A1 Drawing for Submission A and submit on LMS by the due date;<br></p><p><strong>FOLLOWING WEEKS up to SUBMISSION B</strong></p><p> - Set out to build the selected structural bay with all its components as a 3D model in software of your choice. </p><p> - Select the axonometric view which will constitute the basis for the A1 drawing for Submission B, and confirm it with your Tutor. </p><p>(ie: bring the drawing of the proposed axonometric view printed to scale on A1 to be approved at this Tutorial)</p><p>- Refer to Examples of Previous Submissions;</p><p>- Produce a Draft A1 as per Submission B template on LMS to pin up and review at the Tutorial each week;<br></p><p>- Review the weekly development of both your 3D model and the actual A1 print of the axonometric drawing;</p><p>- This should be a detailed architectural 3D drawing focusing on the elements uncovered in the investigation completed for Submission A.</p><p>- This A1 should be a clearly readable highly detailed line-drawing displaying textures, shadows and material qualities of the selected building.</p><p>- This A1 should include carefully edited and aligned labels providing concise technical description of each component of the building.</p><p>- Finalize the Two-dimensional A1 Drawing for Submission B and submit on LMS by the due date;<br></p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong></p><p>- Remember: you are the expert of the selected building, and you need all your research at hand to review your investigation with your Tutor. </p><p>- Research material has to be brought to each Tutorial for reference in hard-copy form (A4 Booklet or file); </p><p>- Drawings can be digitally produced, hand-drawn and may employ any mixed media as required. </p><p>- Drawings will require at least the combination of line-drawings, rendering, and digital overlaying techniques. </p><p>- A1 drawing should be presented to your Tutor at each Tutorial.</p><p><strong>ON-LINE TUTORIAL REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p><p>- Same weekly requirements apply to on-line Tutorials, however students enrolled in on-line Tutorials need to upload their A1 Drawing every week on TUESDAY by 4pm on LMS.</p><p>- A1 Drawing needs to be uploaded as a PDF file of less than 20 MB.</p><p>- Failing to successfully upload the A1 Drawing on LMS will result in the work not being reviewed by the Tutor for the week.</p><p><strong>GUIDE FOR SELECTION OF ARCHITECT / BUILDING:</strong></p><p>The main criteria for the selection of your building are: </p><p>- The Architect needs to be an internationally recognised architect (eg. Pritzker prize winner or similarly celebrated architect);</p><p>- The Building needs to be of medium to large scale of any type but most likely not a single residence (eg. Generally more than 3 levels or 10 meters in height); </p><p>- The most important criteria however is that you select a building that truly interests you. </p><p>A list of recommended architects follows: </p><p>Tadao Ando, Alejandro Aravena, Shigeru Ban, David Chipperfield, Le Corbusier, Norman Foster, Zaha Hadid, Herzog &amp; DeMeuron, Steven Holl, Toyo Ito, Louis Kahn, Christian Kerez, Rem Koolhass OMA, Kengo Kuma, Paulo Mendes Da Rocha, Rafael Moneo, Morphosis, Nieto Soberano, Pierluigi Nervi, Oscar Niemeyer, Jean Nouvel, Renzo Piano, RCR Architects, Richard Rogers, Kazuyo Sejima, &amp; Ryue Nishisawa SANAA, Wang Shu, Alvaro Siza, Eduardo Souto De Moura, Mies Van der Rohe, Peter Zumthor, Grafton Architects, Lacaton and Vassal, MVRDV, 6A Architects, David Adjaye, MGM Architects, Diller Scofidio Renfro, Selgascano </p><p>The Following Buildings will not be allowed as the subject of any Submission:</p><p>Kunsthaus Bregenz, Seagram Building, Placa Europa, Lloyds Building, Kolumba Museum, Pompidou Centre, Soulages Museum, Caixa Forum, Contemporary Arts Centre Cordoba, New Musuem.</p><p>Additionally, any building featuring in the examples provided on LMS is also not allowed as the subject of any submission.<br></p><p> </p><p><strong>GROUP-WORK and PLAGIARISM </strong></p><p>Please note all aspects of your investigation and submissions are individual: all work presented at the Tutorials and prepared for each Submission needs to be solely your own. Be advised that Tutors will keep records of all selected buildings and relevant students and submissions through the years. All submissions investigating the same buildings will be carefully cross-checked for plagiarism and academic misconduct more generally.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p></p></pre></p>

Self-plagiarism is considered a serious breach of academic integrity and is defined by the university as the recycling, copying, or disguising of previous work for assessment in a unit.</p><p><strong><u>Assessment</u></strong></p><p>In the case of folio units, to pass this unit, a student must: (a) achieve an overall mark of 50 per cent or higher for the unit; and (b) achieve the requisite requirements(s) or a mark of 50 per cent or greater, whichever is higher and specified in the unit outline, for the final folio component.</p><p><strong><u>Moderation of marks</u></strong></p><p>Students should be aware that marks can be adjusted in the period of time between a mark being given for an assessment item and the final mark in the official release of results by Student Administration. Students are referred to Part 1, Section 11.4 of the University Policy on: Assessment under Adjustment of Marks. <a href='https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Policy/Policy/Teaching-and-Research-Training/Learning-and-Teaching/Assessment/Assessment-Policy.rtf' target='_blank' >https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Policy/Policy/Teaching-and-Research-Training/Learning-and-Teaching/Assessment/Assessment-Policy.rtf</a></p><p>Criterion based assessment is designed to provide a measure of students' performance that is directly relevant to the learning outcomes. This approach to assessment provides an indication of the specific knowledge and skills each student can demonstrate through an assessment task.  The use of moderation (as currently defined in the assessment policy below) can and should be used where appropriate. </p><p>Moderation is defined in the University Policy on Assessment (the Policy) as “a process to ensure consistent, fair and reliable marking against academic standards” (definitions section). It is “employed to ensure appropriate and consistent marking standards within units, and that assessment outcomes are fair and reliable”. </p><p><strong><u>LMS File Size for Digital Submission </u></strong></p><p>Unless otherwise stated in this unit outline, please note that the maximum file size for digital upload to the Learning Management System (LMS) is 20MB. Files that are incorrect in format or are substantially over this file size limit may not be marked.  Please allow adequate time to upload to LMS, upload time is not grounds for special consideration.</p><p><strong><u>Authenticity of work</u></strong></p><p>We need to be able to establish the authenticity and authorship of your work, thus the minimum requirement for attendance is defined as no less than half the number of tutorials or studio sessions which are contributing, in process and development, to a submission.</p><p><strong><u>Submission of Late Work </u></strong></p><p>Unless otherwise stated, all assessment tasks are due no later than 4pm on the date indicated in the unit's Assessment Items, with the exception of in-class assessment items such as tutorial presentations. Any assessment task which is submitted after the time indicated in the assessment items statement without a formal approved extension will be considered LATE and appropriate penalties will be applied. Information on penalties can be obtained in the Policy on Assessment at <a href='https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Policy/Policy/Teaching-and-Research-Training/Learning-and-Teaching/Assessment/Assessment-Policy.rtf' target='_blank' >https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Policy/Policy/Teaching-and-Research-Training/Learning-and-Teaching/Assessment/Assessment-Policy.rtf</a></p><p>Excluding digital assessments, all late assessments are to be submitted to the School of Design’s front office.</p><p><strong><u>Extensions </u></strong></p><p>The School approves extensions only in exceptional circumstances in order to ensure that all students are treated fairly and that submission date schedules, which are designed to produce ordered work patterns for students, are not disrupted. Extensions may be authorised only by the allocated School Student Experience Course Advising Office or a delegated representative. In all cases, requests for extensions require the submission of Special Consideration form no later than three University working days after the due date.</p><p>Students are encouraged in the strongest possible terms to familiarise themselves with the Policy on Special Consideration available at  <a href='https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Policy/Policy/Student-Administration/Special-Consideration/Special-Consideration-Policy.rtf' target='_blank' >https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Policy/Policy/Student-Administration/Special-Consideration/Special-Consideration-Policy.rtf</a></p><p><strong><u>Feedback </u></strong></p><p>Marked assessments submitted on time will be made available for collection by students at least one week before the next assessment in the unit is due (if it is related to the previous assessment), or no more than 15 University working days after submission, whichever is sooner.</p><p><strong><u>Building clean-up and folio collection (for units with folio submissions)</u></strong></p><p>Studios are expected to be left clean and tidy. Drawing boards are to be cleaned. Students must remove all personal property immediately after the submission of their folio. If the content of a folio is used for exhibition then the student must write their name on the back of the work so that when the exhibition is demounted collection is simplified. If staff or the Faculty wish to reserve work for reproduction and/or accreditation purposes then this should be negotiated with individual students.</p><p><strong><u>Charter of student rights and responsibilities </u></strong></p><p>The Charter of Student Rights and Responsibilities upholds the fundamental rights of students who undertake their education at the University of Western Australia.   The University's charter of Student Rights and Responsibilities is available at   <a href='https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Policy/Policy/Student-Administration/Charter-of-Student-Right-and-Responsibilities/Charter-of-Student-Rights-and-Responsibilities.rtf' target='_blank' >https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Policy/Policy/Student-Administration/Charter-of-Student-Right-and-Responsibilities/Charter-of-Student-Rights-and-Responsibilities.rtf</a></p><p><strong><u>UniAccess </u></strong></p><p>UniAccess provides free services and support to UWA students who want to disclose a disability or a medical condition and request assistance <a href='http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/experience/health/uniaccess' target='_blank' >http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/experience/health/uniaccess</a></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
