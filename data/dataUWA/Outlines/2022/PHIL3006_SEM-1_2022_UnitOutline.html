As Philosophy East and West works best as a highly interactive unit, every effort has been made in its planning to encourage attendance through the participation component (while being flexible). In the event of a lockdown, this unit will move entirely online with assessment structures remaining largely intact.&nbsp;</p><p>Should Covid absences become so widespread as to make it impractical to manage participation, marks from the participation component, from that point onwards, will be re-allocated to essays and the exam. Updates will be made on LMS announcements.&nbsp;</p></p>

                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Around 2500 years ago the historical Buddha set out on a quest to discover and eliminate suffering – initially understood as mental suffering (e.g., fear, anxiety, unhappiness). The story goes that he discovered the root cause of suffering to be a pervasive attachment to things being one way rather than another! The way out of suffering would be to uproot this attachment via a massive cognitive shift. The Buddha was famously said to have attained this freedom from suffering: an exalted mode of being known as nibbāna. What are known as ‘The Four Noble Truths’ diagnose the cause and cure for suffering en route to nibbāna. All other Buddhist teachings, such as the law of kamma, no-self, and the nature of nibbānic consciousness open out from this core structure, which this unit examines in the first half of semester.&nbsp;</p><p>But is Buddhism the only path that purports to end suffering? No: there are other Eastern and mystical traditions that travel in the same direction. We focus, in the second part of the unit, on Advaita Vedanta, a form of Hinduism that calls this attainment mokṣa. Whether mokṣa and nibbāna could come to the same thing is something we’ll investigate. The final section of the unit brings everything together by asking: ‘Now we have a better idea of what is meant by these Eastern claims, are they philosophically plausible?’ The psychological possibility of nibbāna or mokṣa carries fascinating metaphysical implications as to how reality would have to be structured if they really were attainable. Perhaps everything would have to be grounded in a pure universal consciousness rather than a mind-independent material world! We look into what this could mean and what it would take to argue for it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

A roll will be taken as evidence of in-class attendance. Should you be in Streams 2 or 3, but find yourself able to attend a lecture in lieu of sending notes, that is encouraged. Conversely, those in Stream 1 can send me notes if they miss the odd lecture, although it must be for a good reason (you can let me know directly) as attendance in this Stream is the default.</p><p>Those in Streams 2 or 3 are to earn their participation mark by regularly sending me lecture summaries of the lectures that are missed in person. This is to ensure that people are up to speed for the tutorials and don’t fall behind in the unit. These notes must have your name and be dated with the date of the lecture, and be emailed to me with the subject heading 'Tuesday Lecture notes' or 'Thursday Lecture notes' by 9am of the day after the lecture. Just to be clear, the Tuesday lecture-notes need emailing to me by Wednesday at 9am; Thursday’s lecture-notes by Friday at 9am.  To earn your mark, the notes, which can be handwritten and scanned, must be detailed enough to show evidence of having comprehensively listened to the whole lecture, rather than just by skimming or looking at the slides. If you take a phone picture of your handwritten notes please ensure that what you send me is legible. So that you keep up to date (and I am saved administrative overload) extensions are discouraged and are not permitted beyond 5pm of the day after the lecture.</p><p>To relieve administrative burden on Student Services, students in any of the streams will have 'free passes' to miss TWO  lectures &amp;/or their written summaries in the semester, without having to apply for Special consideration. Please use these wisely. </p><p>In the case of lockdown, live online lectures will take place in the same timeslots. The same rules will apply unless Covid absences become so widespread that participation is impractical. If that happens, lecture-recordings from previous years may become available in lieu of live online lectures, and the lecture participation marks from that point onwards will be reallocated to essays and the exam.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tutorial Participation (5%)</strong></p><p>Students will be expected to attend one tutorial per week, whether in-person or online. </p><p>Tutorial participation, whether in-person or online, involves attending tutorials and actively asking questions or listening.  For tutorials, you are expected to have done the weekly reading, as indicated in the Unit Schedule, and I will be guiding discussion in a way that presupposes familiarity with the readings. To help you to actively navigate the salient points in each reading, I will be providing a weekly question sheet based on that week’s reading. Please attempt to answer these before the tutorial! You will understand the reading much better and it will massively improve the quality of tutorial discussion. Print these sheets out (including your answers) and take them to the tutorial. </p><p>As with the FtF tutorials, a roll is taken in online tutorials; the sessions are not recorded. To earn their participation mark, students in the online tutorial must demonstrate attendance by having their camera on with their face in view for duration of the session. This shows kindness for your fellow students and lecturer – it is discombobulating and unconducive to learning (not to mention a little creepy) to be conversing with blank squares on the screen. Most computers have webcams built in, but for those who don’t, please procure one for these purposes.  Webcams, which usually come with an inbuilt microphone, can be purchased from places such as Arrow Computers, Officeworks or online.</p><p>Students will have a free pass to miss ONE tutorial in the semester without having to apply for Special Consideration. Use wisely.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of lockdown, all tutorials will go online, in the same timeslots, and the rules for online tutorials will apply to all. To prepare for this contingency have your tech and webcams ready! Should Covid become too widespread, with multiple absences, the tutorial participation requirement will be dropped and marks from that point onwards re-allocated to essays and the exam.&nbsp;<br></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>

                        <li>serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend</li>
                        <li>serious injury</li>
                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
