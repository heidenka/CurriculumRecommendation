                        <p><p>In the event of a shutdown due to COVID-19, you will be contacted by the unit coordinator via Announcements on LMS [and/or email]. Lecturers and teaching staff will facilitate and support online sessions when face-to-face sessions are not able to be conducted. These online sessions will be in the format of live lectures, pre-recorded lectures, live tutorials and workshops. Live online sessions will use Blackboard Collaborate Ultra or Teams [TBA]. Links for scheduled sessions will be made available in the navigation panel in LMS and further instructions will be provided via announcements.</p><p>Online learning during the event of COVID-19 lockdown</p><p>To ensure Blackboard Collaborate Ultra / TEAMs runs smoothly for your UWA sessions, please ensure you have tested audio/video in advance. A headset and a microphone provide a clear way to capture your voice and allow you to more clearly hear conversations. You will be encouraged to participate in online group work or in Q&amp;A.</p><p>Library staff can assist with troubleshooting Uni-ID issues which are so important to accessing the UWA systems via askUWA or email: askuwa-lib@uwa.edu.au.</p><p>Join from a location with a strong and stable internet connection.</p><p>Reduce background noise by going to a private space. A wired connection is best. If you are using WiFi, then connect from your home.</p><p>Appearance matters</p><p>If you are present online, ensure you have a clean background (what is visible behind you in your physical location) to ensure that it’s appropriate/not distracting and use the blur function if available. Check your lighting conditions. Lastly, be aware of your behaviour. When you are on video, people can see what you are doing at all times. It can be easy to forget you’re on camera, so just be mindful.</p><p>Online etiquette</p><p>Please remember that while learning online the University Charter of Students Rights and Responsibilities still applies.</p></p>

                                    <td>In this unit, students develop their patient history taking, communication, professionalism, reflective practice and manual dexterity skills by engaging in experiential learning in the UWA Podiatry Clinic to provide care to low risk patients. Students also engage in simulated work place learning to develop their understanding and application of safe practice management by demonstrating skills in clinical record keeping, gaining consent, patient confidentiality, podiatric assisting and explaining relevant mandatory policies and protocols in podiatric practice. Students are exposed to the application of therapeutic management of podiatric patients here. Students also develop clinical assessment skills, diagnostic principles and are able to justify assessment techniques to diagnose foot and ankle conditions and implement evidence based conservative treatments, while applying the principles of infection prevention and control protocols. Students learn the application of biomechanical principles to orthotic therapy and fundamentals of clinical assessments and conservative care, to then learn how to design,develop and manufacture a custom made foot orthoses to support and treat patients with foot & ankle pathologies with foot orthoses.

Students also engage in simulated work place learning to develop their understanding and application of safe practice management by demonstrating skills in clinical record keeping, gaining consent, patient confidentiality, podiatric assisting and explaining relevant mandatory policies and protocols in podiatric practice.</p><p>Students are exposed to the application of therapeutic management of podiatric patients here. Students also develop clinical assessment skills, diagnostic principles and are able to justify assessment techniques to diagnose foot and ankle conditions and implement evidence based conservative treatments, while applying the principles of infection prevention and control protocols.</p><p>Students learn the application of biomechanical principles to orthotic therapy and fundamentals of clinical assessments and conservative care, to then learn how to design,develop and manufacture a custom made foot orthoses to support and treat patients with foot &amp; ankle pathologies with foot orthoses.</p><p>Students must abide by the Professional Behaviour Procedure set in out in the experiential work-place learning environments.</p></p></pre></p>

The combination of theoretical and practical aspects of this unit is to help you get the basic skills required to approach more advanced clinical skills required in the later years. We hope that this unit will provide foundational skills as a graduate endorsed podiatrist. This unit will be taught by combining lectures, practical exercises, and self-directed learning.</p><p>Content of the unit is available in WEEKLY CONTENT on LMS. The delivery, content and order of the unit material may vary throughout the semester and will be indicated up to one week prior on LMS announcements.</p><p>Order of lecture/tutorial sessions or material are subject to change and will be notified to students at least 48 hours prior; exceptional circumstances such as injury or sickness will require rescheduling or default to pre-recorded materials.</p></p></pre></p>

Attendance will be taken at these compulsory sessions. Students must ensure they have signed in for the teaching sessions where roll is kept.  It is not the responsibility of the tutor or demonstrator.  You will be considered to be absent if you have not signed in for the session. </p><p>Students can only miss 1 compulsory session during the semester without a medical certificate.  In the case of illness, a medical certificate (not provided by a family member) must be supplied to the unit coordinator within one week of return to classes.  Any missed tasks will need to be completed by this time. Note that the onus is on the student to make contact regarding absences. If a student misses more than this, he/she will be expected to contact the unit coordinator with an explanation.  A failure to provide a valid explanation, or further missed classes will result in action according to the FMDHS Professional Behaviour Assessment, available on the DPM Community LMS page. </p><p>Lateness</p><p>Students who are consistently late to teaching sessions (more than 10 minutes) will be marked as late and an explanation will be sought from the student.  Your fellow students and teachers appreciate punctuality which is part of professional behaviour and courtesy. Multiple late arrivals will be managed according to the FHMS Professional Behaviour Assessment. Late arrival at lectures is also discourteous and unprofessional. If you are unavoidably late, it is important that you do not enter a lecture theatre by the front entrance. </p><p>Adherence to rostered session times</p><p>It is critical that where a student is assigned to attend a particular session at a particular time, only that session may be attended. Students are not to attend non-assigned sessions for their convenience. Students doing so will be subject to the FMDHS Professional Behaviour Assessment process.</p><p>Patient confidentiality</p><p>As podiatry students you are of course not only free to discuss your experiences with each other, but you are actually encouraged to do so. Some teaching may involve discussion of clinical cases. Do not discuss these where you may be overheard by the public. DO NOT upload information or images regarding clinical cases to social media sites.  It is important to remember that any information you learn about a patient should be regarded as a matter of professional confidence.</p></p></pre></p>
