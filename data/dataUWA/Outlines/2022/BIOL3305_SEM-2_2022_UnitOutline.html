                                    <td>Humanity has been extracting marine and aquatic food resources for tens of thousands of years by means of fishing, and these days fishing is the single biggest human impact factor on marine animal populations and marine ecosystems globally, followed by climate change and plastic pollution. The impacts of fishing, be it commercial, recreational or for subsistence, can be felt and seen everywhere in the marine environment, from our coastal systems to the global high seas. Fisheries and their impacts are also a major driving force in the global economy, with seafood now being the most widely traded food commodity in the world. Fisheries also have substantial social implications, ranging from increasing poverty and human migrations in West Africa to the emergence of modern piracy in Somalia and elsewhere. This unit will provide students with a solid grounding in the foundations of fisheries science, and identify features, methods and principles of fisheries science used to inform policy and management of both large and small-scale fisheries around the world. In addition to the scientific foundations and principles around fisheries science, this unit will also provide and discuss a range of applied examples from both global and local West Australian fisheries. Core elements will include the foundation principles of fisheries science, the core data needs in fisheries science, introduction to methods used in assessing fish populations, and their application to fisheries data sets at different scales. Finally, clear links will be made to the growing need to align fisheries science with conservation science and strategies and policies, in order to ensure sustainability of fisheries resources for future generations.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p> </p><p>Unit basics</p><p>Humanity has been extracting marine and aquatic food resources on virtually every coast and in every country for tens of thousands of years by means of fishing, and thereby we have actively driven a large range of changes in the ocean ecosystems. Thus, fishing is the single biggest human impact factor on marine animal populations and marine ecosystems globally, followed more recently by climate change and plastic pollution. The impacts of fishing, be they for commercial, recreational or subsistence purposes, can be felt and seen everywhere in the marine environment, from our coastal systems to the global high seas and the deep oceans. Fisheries and their impacts are also a major driving force in the global economy, with seafood being the most widely traded food commodity in the world. Fisheries also have substantial social implications, ranging from growing social inequity, poverty, food- and nutritional-security, and human migrations in West Africa to the emergence of modern piracy in Somalia and elsewhere. </p><p>This unit will provide students with a broad grounding in the foundations of fisheries science, and identify features, methods and principles of fisheries science used to inform policy and management of both large-scale and small-scale fisheries around the world. In addition to the scientific foundations and principles around fisheries science, this unit will also discuss a range of applied examples from both global and local Western Australian fisheries that highlight spatial and regional differences in management priorities and capacity. Core elements will include the foundation principles of fisheries science, the core data needs in fisheries science, an introduction to methods used in assessing fish populations, and the application of such methods to fisheries data sets at different scales. Finally, clear links will be made to the growing need to align fisheries science with conservation science and strategies and policies to ensure the sustainability of fisheries resources for future generations.</p><p>Staff:</p><p>•	Prof Dirk Zeller, dirk.zeller@uwa.edu.au</p><p>•	Several specialist guest speakers in lectures and labs</p><p>Demonstrator for labs/practicals (class size dependent):</p><p>•	Vania Andreoli</p><p>Lectures (3 @ 1 hour per week):</p><p>1.

Wednesday 10:00-10:45 Boolong Room (G11) in The School of Indigenous Studies (BMARLEE, the new building)</p><p>Lectures are recorded according to UWA principles and are thus available online for review. I encourage personal attendance at lectures, as I engage in questions and discussions during and immediately after lectures.</p><p>Labs/practicals (1 @ 2 hours per week):</p><p>4.	Wednesday 11:00-13:00 Boolong Room (G11) in The School of Indigenous Studies (BMARLEE, the new building)</p><p>Labs are not recorded but contain crucial content and are fundamental to all assessable items. These are not wet lab practicals, but rather dry lab exercises requiring teamwork and guided study for your assessable items. Bringing and using your own laptop in labs is required, as the teaching facility (Boolong Room G11) has no computers. </p><p>The unit does not support online participation due to the crucial content from discussions and one-on-one or group interactions in labs. Data exploration will be central during labs, often requiring or benefiting from staff/demonstrator guidance, and contributes directly to learning outcomes. </p><p>Starting in 2022, students from the UWA Albany campus will participate via video link in the labs. These students are supported by a dedicated tutor at UWA Albany. </p><p>Attending labs is mandatory for the successful completion of this unit, as materials covered and discussed during labs form key components of all assessable items, including the lab report (assignment) and the exam. Each lab will also include a short assessable quiz, which will not be reissued outside the lab in question.</p><p>Reading up on lab topics prior to each lab is essential, i.e., come prepared. This includes the relevant lectures as well as associated readings.</p><p>Special considerations: If you are applying for and are granted a special consideration, it is your responsibility to notify me of this immediately via email, with the special consideration approval included. I do not check special consideration files nor chase after you. I highly recommend you talk to me in all cases where you know beforehand of an upcoming special consideration situation. See below on how I treat special considerations with regards to assessment.</p><p>Generally, this unit does not require specific statistical expertise, but assumes a basic understanding of statistics. Some material may stretch/challenge your mathematical/statistical knowledge, although more in a theoretical and conceptual manner rather than as hands-on requirements. However, critical and logical thinking, and an ability to explore numerical data in graphical form, linked with and embedded in underlying general knowledge on fisheries acquired during this unit, is crucial. Make sure you know how to create and use Excel Pivot Tables and Pivot Table graphs.</p><p>Field trip:</p><p>One Wednesday lecture and lab period (10:00-13:00) will be spent at the WA Fisheries Laboratory in Hillary. Details to follow.</p><p>Assessment:</p><p>Final exam 50%</p><p>Lab report/assignment 30%</p><p>Quizzes 20% </p><p>Lab/practical report:</p><p>A concise and clear 2000 word (+/- 10%) report (not counting title, author, reference list, tables and figure captions) in a scientific paper format will be required from each student. Each student’s individual report will contain data exploration and evaluation of the fisheries data and associated socio-economic patterns back to 1950 for a specific country being assigned to each student. The associated introduction and discussion embeds this in the context of that specific country as well as the geographic and socio-economic region, and the broader global fisheries context as explored in this unit. Early in the semester, each student will be assigned a specific unique country for his/her lab report by the teaching staff. This is not a group report, even if teamwork by geographical country clusters may take place during lab sessions. If you have a specific personal association with a given country, please discuss this as an option with me during the first lab or after the first week’s lectures.  Submission of reports is via LMS Turnitin by the due date. The lab report is likely due in week 9, two weeks after the mid-semester study break. Details to be advised.</p><p>Each report requires the following components (approximate word counts are indicated):</p><p>Title: A fully self-explanatory title of around 10-20 words</p><p>Author: Student’s name and student number, Unit number</p><p>Abstract: No more than 200 words, no references to be cited in Abstract</p><p>Introduction: Around 300 words</p><p>Methods: Around 300 words</p><p>Results: Around 400 words, generally should not contain any references as this is your work, data and analysis. </p><p>Discussion: Around 800 words</p><p>References: Complete list of all references cited in the text and tables, as well as table and figure captions. Referencing “style” to be used is for the journal called “Marine and Freshwater Research”, and citation and reference formatting should be consistent with that journal style, and the reference list entry needs to be complete enough for a Google and/or library search to find the exact reference, including volume and page numbers, and where available the DOI number.</p><p>Tables and Figures to be embedded within the text, in sequence of first citation. Tables and figures to be sized to present the point being made, but not use up unnecessary space. Each table and figure needs to be cited at least once in either Introduction, Methods and/or Results. Tables and Figures should be placed as close as possible to, but ideally after first citing in text, and each should have a comprehensive, self-explanatory caption. Table captions are integrated into each table as the first row of that table. Figure captions are stand-alone, comprehensive and fully self-explanatory texts below each figure. Tables and figures are numbered consecutively, but independently, i.e., Table 1, Table 2 etc.; Figure 1, Figure 2 etc.</p><p>Please use “i.e.” versus “e.g.” in a grammatically correct manner.</p><p>Labs during the first half of the unit focus heavily on the data exploration and aspects of the lab report assignment, and much of your lab report data exploration and analysis, material, content and even report writing can be generated by you in the lab sessions during which staff and demonstrator support is available. No support will be provided for lab report preparation or data examination outside of the designated lab time slots, so come prepared to each lab, and maximize your time use during each lab. Do not leave it to the last 1 or 2 lab sessions to ask for help, as that may be too late!</p><p>Quizzes</p><p>These will be paper-based and short, and will be administered during each lab session, starting in week 2, with in-person submission due within 10-15 minutes in the same lab. They cover materials from lectures and practical sessions from previous weeks. No same-week lecture materials will be assessed within a given week. Missed quizzes will not be re-issued, no exception. The best way to prepare is by staying up-to-date on unit content!</p><p>Reading lists:</p><p>There is no set textbook, however, numerous reading lists will be provided for various sections/topics, usually via uploaded files on LMS. Core reading items will be fully assessable, and it is expected that you understand the main messages and findings from the core readings. Lecture slides include references that form part of the reading expectations, even if not listed in the reading lists. Most reading items are peer-reviewed papers or reports, all of which are available via online searches. I consider the reading list(s) as a starting point for your learning experience and knowledge accumulation for this unit. As young scientists, you need to read widely and copiously… start now. The art of reading for this unit is to focus heavily on the Abstracts, Introductions, Results and Discussions of each paper, more so than on the Methods. I openly welcome and encourage being pointed to other papers that you find that are related to specific topics that may or may not be on the reading list(s).</p><p>Learning and teaching outcomes and strategies</p><p>Students are able to (1) describe the current state of knowledge, core principles, methods and fundamental data needs of fisheries science, population dynamics, stock assessments and fisheries economics in a global context; (2) critically analyse the place and role of developed and developing countries in global fisheries and fisheries science; (3) describe small-scale versus large-scale fisheries around the world, understand and assess their challenges for sustainability, food security and food supply, and critically analyse potential solutions; (4) assess novel data sources, methods and approaches to fisheries science; and (5) assess the role of no-take areas in global fisheries.</p><p>Referencing:</p><p>Proper referencing of someone else’s work, findings, thoughts and writings is paramount in science, and is the only ethical, professional way to use, re-use and mention someone else’s work. Direct quotes should be avoided entirely in biological sciences, although they are common in social sciences. In the extremely rare cases where direct quotes are acceptable in biological writing (you are unlikely to encounter this in your writing in this unit), direct quotes always need to be bracketed, e.g., “this text is a quote” (Zeller, 2021), and also need to be referenced. Instead, in the natural sciences, we paraphrase someone else’s findings or thoughts, i.e., we re-write what they say or found in our own words. However, paraphrasing also needs a citation showing where you got the thought, finding or idea from.</p><p>Do not plagiarize, as this is cheating and unethical, and will be heavily penalized. Any evidence of plagiarism in your writing will be immediately forwarded to the relevant university committee for consequences and penalization. </p><p>I encourage you to read and digest the relevant UWA resources, e.g.:</p><p><a href='https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/referencinguwa' target='_blank' >https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/referencinguwa</a>  </p><p>I strongly recommend you use a referencing software to avoid mistakes in citations and referencing. My preferred software is EndNote, which is also supported by UWA. For example, your lab report should include EndNote references (or another citation software of your choice such as Mendeley), both as citation inserts in the text, as well as the auto-assembled reference list at the end for your report. If you use referencing software, do not cite any references manually in your text. Please use the journal reference style of Marine and Freshwater Research.</p><p>Know and understand the difference in use of:</p><p>(Author, year) versus Author (year)</p><p>Other:</p><p>Use of your own laptop during all labs is essential. Software requirements are only Microsoft Office (Excel, Word) or a Mac equivalent, as well as an internet browser.</p><p>All lecture and lab materials, as well as all core readings are assessable.</p><p></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations</h4>

                        <li>serious injury</li>
                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The full policy and information on applying for special consideration is available at <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">in the UWA Policy Library </a></p>
