The unit examines identity and worldview and the wider society's attitudes towards Aboriginal people and what people mean when they speak of 'Aboriginal education'. Students are asked to critically reflect on how they locate themselves, their world views and perceptions within Aboriginal Education. The unit will examine historical relationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia and the impact of colonisation, governmental policies and practices on all aspects of life and, in particular, education. 'Aboriginal education' is considered in the context of social justice and Indigenous and human rights issues which continue to affect Aboriginal people and their relationships with the wider Australian community. The focus of this unit is to help develop cultural understandings that will enable teachers to embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives and draw on strategies that are culturally responsive within an educational context.</td>

The unit examines identity and worldview and the wider society's attitudes towards Aboriginal people and what people mean when they speak of 'Aboriginal education'. Students are asked to critically reflect on how they locate themselves, their world views and perceptions within Aboriginal Education. The unit will examine historical relationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia and the impact of colonisation, governmental policies and practices on all aspects of life and in particular, education. 'Aboriginal education' is considered in the context of social justice and Indigenous and human rights issues which continue to affect Aboriginal people and their relationships with the wider Australian community. The focus of this unit is to help develop cultural understandings that will enable teachers to embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives and draw on strategies that are culturally responsive within an educational context.</p></p></pre></p>

Remember that the term ‘critical’ in this context does not mean ‘criticise”, ‘critical’ in this context means digging and analysing through a reflective process. Refer back to the Howard reading to assist your critical reflection. In addition, the purpose of guiding questions is for you to use these to reflect on certain aspects before you begin to write. A suggestion would be to jot down your thoughts as you use the questions to reflect, then read all your thoughts before you attempt to write. This will enable you to build a wholistic picture of your critical reflection, this will help you see connections and other insights that will deeply enrich your written critical reflection.<br></p><p><i style=""><strong>Critical Reflection Table/Guiding Questions - Critical Reflective Questions with Explanation </strong>(this platform does not support uploading tables so I have listed the questions with explanations)</i></p><p>1.

This guide is to inform you on preferred terminology for the School of Indigenous Studies, so you can become more confident in your choices about what terms to use. However, it is not definitive and cannot cover all contexts, so as a general rule, if in doubt, ASK first!</p><p><strong><i>Collective and Inclusive Terms</i></strong></p><p>‘Indigenous people(s)’ and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people(s)’ are terms commonly used to collectively refer to Australia’s first peoples.  </p><p>‘Indigenous peoples’ is a term most frequently used in an international context, particularly in relation to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) and The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples <a href='https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/' target='_blank' >https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/</a></p><p>For more information see:  Indigenous Peoples Indigenous Voices Fact Sheet: Who Are Indigenous Peoples? <a href='http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf' target='_blank' >http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf</a></p><p>Some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people object to using the term ‘Indigenous’ because it fails to respect their own identity and preferences and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ is the preferred term. </p><p>However, both terms ‘Indigenous people(s)’ and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people(s)’ are acceptable to use in the course. Use capital letters for ‘Indigenous’ and ‘Aboriginal’ when you are referring specifically to Aboriginal peoples in Australia.</p><p>In many areas, the term ‘Aboriginal people’ is increasingly used in preference to ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’.  In Western Australia there has been a clear and stated community preference for use of the term ‘Aboriginal people’ as the inclusive term rather than ‘Indigenous’ or ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’. This is demonstrated by the following examples from two key government agencies:  </p><p>•	In 2013, Western Australia’s Department of Indigenous Affairs replaced the term ‘Indigenous’ in its title with ‘Aboriginal’, its stated reason being that: "The Department of Aboriginal Affairs (formerly Indigenous Affairs) has been renamed to more accurately reflect the identity of Aboriginal people in Western Australia. This change is in line with requests from the State's Aboriginal community." <a href='https://www.daa.wa.gov.au/' target='_blank' >https://www.daa.wa.gov.au/</a></p><p>•	The Department of Health (WA) stated rationale on using the term ‘Aboriginal’ is that: "Within Western Australia, the term Aboriginal is used in preference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, in recognition that Aboriginal people are the original inhabitants of Western Australia. No disrespect is intended to our Torres Strait Islander colleagues and community”.  <a href='http://www.health.gov.au/indigenous' target='_blank' >http://www.health.gov.au/indigenous</a></p><p>‘Aboriginal people(s)’ is also appropriate to use in the course. </p><p><strong><i>Diverse Communities</i></strong></p><p>‘Aboriginal’ and ‘Indigenous’ are both terms imposed after colonisation, which don’t reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of the more than 250 Aboriginal language groups across Australia as well as the diversity within each of these groups. </p><p>Aboriginal peoples prefer to identify themselves in their own language terms e.g. Noongar, Palyku, Yamatji.  Students should be sensitive to this use, but care should be taken to have an appropriate Aboriginal reference point when using these terms. It can be confusing as spellings may have changed over time or may merely reflect regional or individual preferences. For example, UWA uses ‘Noongar’ as per the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council <a href='http://www.noongar.org.au' target='_blank' >http://www.noongar.org.au</a></p><p><strong><i>Language and Terminology to Avoid</i></strong></p><p>The term ‘Aborigine(s)’ is often regarded as having negative connotations and is now regarded as less appropriate, out-dated or even offensive, so use ‘Aboriginal people’ instead.</p><p>Generally avoid abbreviations, as they are like to be offensive.</p><p>•	There is no acceptable abbreviation for ‘Aboriginal’. </p><p>•	Do not use ATSI as an abbreviation of ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’ in written or oral communication.  Exceptions to this are in the context of a recognised acronym for an organisation e.g. ‘AIATSIS’ is the acronym for the ‘Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies’.</p><p>Avoid using anthropological terms such as clans, tribes. Aboriginal people do not generally use these terms in Western Australia you can refer instead to ‘Aboriginal communities’ or ‘Aboriginal language groups’. </p><p>‘Aboriginal’ and ‘non-Aboriginal’ people should be used in preference to ‘black’ and ‘white’ people etc.  </p><p>While Aboriginal people may use terms/language to refer to themselves, such as ‘blackfellas’, this does not imply permission for other people to use such terms.</p><p>For further guidelines on the use of appropriate language please refer to the Queensland based:</p><p><a href='http://www.ipswich.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/10043/appropriate_indigenous_terminoloy.pdf' target='_blank' >http://www.ipswich.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/10043/appropriate_indigenous_terminoloy.pdf</a></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>

UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
