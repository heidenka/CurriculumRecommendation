The unit examines identity and worldview and the wider society's attitudes towards Aboriginal people and what people mean when they speak of 'Aboriginal education'. Students are asked to critically reflect on how they locate themselves, their world views and perceptions within Aboriginal Education. The unit will examine historical relationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia and the impact of colonisation, governmental policies and practices on all aspects of life and, in particular, education. 'Aboriginal education' is considered in the context of social justice and Indigenous and human rights issues which continue to affect Aboriginal people and their relationships with the wider Australian community. The focus of this unit is to help develop cultural understandings that will enable teachers to embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives and draw on strategies that are culturally responsive within an educational context.</td>

The unit examines identity and worldview and the wider society's attitudes towards Aboriginal people and what people mean when they speak of 'Aboriginal education'. Students are asked to critically reflect on how they locate themselves, their world views and perceptions within Aboriginal Education. The unit will examine historical relationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia and the impact of colonisation, governmental policies and practices on all aspects of life and in particular, education. 'Aboriginal education' is considered in the context of social justice and Indigenous and human rights issues which continue to affect Aboriginal people and their relationships with the wider Australian community. The focus of this unit is to help develop cultural understandings that will enable teachers to embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives and draw on strategies that are culturally responsive within an educational context.<p>Students need to be available for a proposed field trip, which will be of no cost to the student. Details are further on in the unit outline and specific details will be confirmed in first/second week of the teaching period.</p><p>This unit focuses on the Graduate APSTs [Australian Professional Standards for Teaching] 1.4 and 2.4 and is also linked to APSPTs 1.5,3.7, 4.1, 7.3 and 7.4</p><p>1.4 Graduate – Strategies for teaching Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students: Demonstrate broad knowledge and understanding of the impact of culture, cultural identity and linguistic background on the education of students from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories, culture and languages.</p><p>2.4 Graduate – Understand and respect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to promote reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians: Demonstrate a broad knowledge of, understanding of and respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories, cultures and languages.</p><p>1.5 Graduate - Differentiate teaching to meet the specific learning needs of students across the full range of abilities: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of strategies for differentiating teaching to meet the specific learning needs of students across the full range of abilities</p><p>3.7 Graduate - Engage parents/carers in the educative process: Describe a broad range of strategies for involving parents/carers in the educative process.</p><p>4.1 Graduate - Support student participation: Identify strategies to support inclusive student participation and engagement in classroom activities.</p><p>7.3 Graduate - Engage with the parents/carers: Understand strategies for working effectively, sensitively and confidentially with parents/carers</p><p>7.4 Graduate – Engage with Professional Teaching Networks and Broader Communities: Understand the role of external professionals and community representatives in broadening teachers’ professional knowledge and practice</p></p></pre></p>

The unit design follows principles of the ‘flipped classroom” and a dialogic approach. You can access this link for more information on ‘Flipped Classrooms” <a href='https://www.adelaide.edu.au/flipped-classroom/about/' target='_blank' >https://www.adelaide.edu.au/flipped-classroom/about/</a> and about dialogic approaches <a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00140/full' target='_blank' >https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00140/full</a></p><p>A dialogic and transformative learning approach is fundamental to the workshop design of this unit. Workshops will be interactive using both activity based and dialogic approaches. To be able to engage in the classroom dialogue and activities students will need to reflect on and analyse their understandings the content/points in unit materials provided in the workshop preparation tasks on LMS which include lecture videos; and guided reading and viewing. Critical reflective components of the activities and the dialogic approaches are designed stimulate students’ transformative learning and facilitate deeper understandings.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

This is the requirement for all 6 credit point units.</p><p><strong>Workshop Preparation Tasks </strong>(includes pre-recorded lectures, readings/viewing tasks)</p><p>10 weeks pre-recorded lectures and reading/viewing preparation tasks– accessible from the weekly folders in Learning Materials.</p><p><strong>Workshops</strong></p><p>10 x 2 hour weekly workshops, [see Unit Schedule and workshop guides for details]. Workshops are dialogic and practical. This requires students to have competed the workshop preparation task to be able to fully participate in their learning and achieved the unit learning outcomes.</p><p>Please check CAS for particulars and updates on workshop times and rooms.</p><p><strong>Learning on Country – Excursion</strong></p><p>Kings Park Cultural Walk and Talk Excursion by the Walley family proposed week, week 10.  No cost to students as the School of Indigenous Studies covers costs for the students. Further details will be announced on our LMS Announcements and an email registration will be emailed to your UWA student email.</p><p>Learning on Country is a significant component of learning for Indigenous students/peoples and also for non-Indigenous students/peoples’ learning. Country encompasses more than just the physical environment, it is knowledge, the ancestors, kin/people and spiritual. Learning on Country is a way of learning through connecting with Country and the knowledge within Country.</p><p>Further information, session times and registration details will be provided via email and LMS.</p><p><strong><i>Non-Teaching Weeks: 6 March – 10 March Non-teaching study break (Labour Day), no classes this week for EDUC5429</i></strong></p><p><strong>KEY REVISIONS TO THE UNIT EDUC5429 AS A RESULT OF 2022 STUDENT SURVEY FEEDBACK for EDUC5429</strong></p><p>•	Week 1 is more focussed on understanding the significance of the unit and how to navigate weekly learning and the assessments.</p><p>•	As the cohort is now mainly 1st year students who are new to concepts of teaching and pedagogy, the workshops and assessments are more focussed in guiding students in understanding how they can make culturally safe and appropriate choices in their role as a teacher and to guide them in searching, locating, evaluating and justifying appropriate activities for embedding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures and for teaching Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.</p><p>•	Reintroduced ‘recap’ time at the end of sessions in workshop guide.</p><p>•	Endeavoured to space assessments as best as possible, though each year provides different hurdles and this year we have Easter interrupting our last 2 weeks of semester.</p></p></pre></p>

This presentation is assessed by your tutor and you will be provided a group mark. Each group will complete a peer/self-assessment, this will be for self-development purposes and not contribute to your mark and you will hand this to your tutor on the day of your presentation. However, in a case of unresolved conflict the tutor will refer to this document. See the Guide for Group Presentation further below, after the list of Themes and Schedules.</p><p>Group size = 4 - 5 members. However, larger classes will need to adapt group size.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is NOT a lecture style group presentation.</p><p><strong><i>Themes and Schedule:</i></strong> Refer to the presentation schedule below and the Unit Schedule in the unit outline; the weekly folders and the Unit Readings Library on LMS to understand the focus of the topic and to access the reading/viewing content, according to the theme.</p><p>Group 1/W5 Theme: Supporting Aboriginal Child / Youth Health and Well-being -covered in week 3 (extra guidance provided by tutor)</p><p>•	You can choose activities from a variety of learning areas (majors/minors). Note: think about how identity and/or culture is reflected or supported in the activity/resources or texts you would use. </p><p>Group 2/W6 Theme: Relationships / Knowing Your Students – covered in week 4.</p><p>•	Think about types of activities/topics that would encourage students to share their ways of thinking, learning and doing. What may encourage students to connect with you, for them to share more about themselves privately with you.</p><p>Group 3/W7 Theme: Strength Based Pedagogies – covered in week 6</p><p>•	Think about how to use the strengths that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students bring to your learning area (major/minor, humanities/STEM). What activity, student cultural knowledge/topics and problem-solving strategies or students’ ways of learning would work with their strengths? </p><p>Group 4/W9 Theme: Aboriginal English / Language – covered in week 7</p><p>•	Aboriginal English / Language is taken into account in all learning areas. How might you support Aboriginal English / Language in your learning area (major/minor)?</p><p>Group 5/W9 Theme: Aboriginal History or STEM: Indigenous Knowledges – covered in week 8/6. More STEM information in the Learning Materials Week 9 folder and in the Unit Readings Week 9 folders.</p><p>•	This is learning area specific.

This assignment aligns with Unit Outcomes 2 and 3.</p><p>Critical Reflection Table/Guiding Questions: These questions are a guide for critical reflective thinking, they are not necessarily a format for writing. Remember that the term ‘critical’ in this context does not mean ‘criticise”, ‘critical’ in this context means digging and analysing through a reflective process. Refer back to the Howard reading to assist your critical reflection. In addition, the purpose of guiding questions is for you to use these to reflect on certain aspects before you begin to write. A suggestion would be to jot down your thoughts as you use the questions to reflect, then read all your thoughts before you attempt to write. This will enable you to build a wholistic picture of your critical reflection, this will help you see connections and other insights that will deeply enrich your written critical reflection.</p><p><strong><i>Critical Reflection Guide Questions – this is the reflection process before you write</i></strong></p><p>Focussed Critical Reflective Guiding Questions</p><p>Connecting to the topic/content - What has been written/said that caused me to reflect critically?

Written literacy and referencing expectations will normally be incorporated into assignment rubrics</p><p><strong>ADDITIONAL DETAILED ASSESSMENT INFORMATION</strong></p><p>Please ensure you follow the "Guide To Appropriate Language And Terminology" on LMS in the Assessment folder when writing and presenting your assignments and below:</p><p><strong><i>A Guide To Appropriate Language And Terminology</i></strong></p><p>It is important to be sensitive to the use of appropriate language and terminology when referring to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. This guide is to inform you on preferred terminology for the School of Indigenous Studies, so you can become more confident in your choices about what terms to use. However, it is not definitive and cannot cover all contexts, so as a general rule, if in doubt, ASK first!</p><p><u>Collective and Inclusive Terms</u></p><p>‘Indigenous people(s)’ and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people(s)’ are terms commonly used to collectively refer to Australia’s first peoples.</p><p>‘Indigenous peoples’ is a term most frequently used in an international context, particularly in relation to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) and The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples <a href='https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/' target='_blank' >https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/</a></p><p>For more information see: Indigenous Peoples Indigenous Voices Fact Sheet: Who Are Indigenous Peoples? <a href='http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf' target='_blank' >http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf</a></p><p>Some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people object to using the term ‘Indigenous’ because it fails to respect their own identity and preferences and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ is the preferred term.</p><p>However, both terms ‘Indigenous people(s)’ and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people(s)’ are acceptable to use in the course. Use capital letters for ‘Indigenous’ and ‘Aboriginal’ when you are referring specifically to Aboriginal peoples in Australia.</p><p>In many areas, the term ‘Aboriginal people’ is increasingly used in preference to ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’. In Western Australia there has been a clear and stated community preference for use of the term ‘Aboriginal people’ as the inclusive term rather than ‘Indigenous’ or ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’. This is demonstrated by the following examples from two key government agencies:</p><p>• In 2013, Western Australia’s Department of Indigenous Affairs replaced the term ‘Indigenous’ in its title with ‘Aboriginal’, its stated reason being that: "The Department of Aboriginal Affairs (formerly Indigenous Affairs) has been renamed to more accurately reflect the identity of Aboriginal people in Western Australia. This change is in line with requests from the State's Aboriginal community." <a href='https://www.daa.wa.gov.au/' target='_blank' >https://www.daa.wa.gov.au/</a></p><p>• The Department of Health (WA) stated rationale on using the term ‘Aboriginal’ is that: "Within Western Australia, the term Aboriginal is used in preference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, in recognition that Aboriginal people are the original inhabitants of Western Australia. No disrespect is intended to our Torres Strait Islander colleagues and community”. <a href='http://www.health.gov.au/indigenous' target='_blank' >http://www.health.gov.au/indigenous</a></p><p>‘Aboriginal people(s)’ is also appropriate to use in the course.</p><p><u>Diverse Communities</u></p><p>‘Aboriginal’ and ‘Indigenous’ are both terms imposed after colonisation, which don’t reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of the more than 250 Aboriginal language groups across Australia as well as the diversity within each of these groups.</p><p>Aboriginal peoples prefer to identify themselves in their own language terms e.g. Noongar, Palyku, Yamatji. Students should be sensitive to this use, but care should be taken to have an appropriate Aboriginal reference point when using these terms. It can be confusing as spellings may have changed over time or may merely reflect regional or individual preferences. For example, UWA uses ‘Noongar’ as per the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council <a href='http://www.noongar.org.au' target='_blank' >http://www.noongar.org.au</a></p><p><u>Language and Terminology to Avoid</u></p><p>The term ‘Aborigine(s)’ is often regarded as having negative connotations and is now regarded as less appropriate, out-dated or even offensive, so use ‘Aboriginal people’ instead.</p><p>Generally avoid abbreviations, as they are like to be offensive.</p><p>• There is no acceptable abbreviation for ‘Aboriginal’.</p><p>• Do not use ATSI as an abbreviation of ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’ in written or oral communication.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
