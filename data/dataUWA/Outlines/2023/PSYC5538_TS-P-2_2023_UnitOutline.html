Note, however, that the mode of unit delivery may change in the interests of student and client safety (e.g., online role-plays only during peak COVID infection periods). Furthermore, additional online resources may also be made available to students (e.g., datasets from previous assessments). More precise details will be made known via LMS announcements, in the event that covid-19 restrictions are imposed.</p></p>

                                    <td>This unit is the first practical placement unit in the Clinical Neuropsychology program and includes a variety of either internal or external placement experiences, or both, completed over the course of a non-standard teaching period (e.g. teaching period P6: 10 months—March through to December). The unit includes a preparation for placement component within the Robin Winkler Clinic identical to that provided in PSYC5678 Practicum I (formerly PSYC8678 Practicum I). There is also a 'risk aware' module which provides training in clinical risk awareness and management.

Students, in consultation with the placement coordinator, choose a variety of assessment and intervention experiences within the internal clinic, and/or external clinical neuropsychological experiences. These experiences allow students an opportunity to work with children, adults and older adults across a range of settings, including an internal neuropsychology community clinic. 

Trainees are able to build basic clinical skills (including interviewing and interventions) as well as skills and experience in psychological and neuropsychological test selection, scoring, interpretation and communication of results during feedback sessions and case conferences, and report writing.</td>

The unit includes a preparation for placement component within the Robin Winkler Clinic (identical to that provided in PSYC5678 Practicum I). There is also an online 'Risk Aware' module that provides training in clinical risk awareness and management. Students, in consultation with the placement coordinators, choose a variety of assessment and intervention experiences within the internal clinic, and/or external clinical neuropsychological experiences. These experiences allow students an opportunity to work with children, adults and older adults across a range of settings, including an internal neuropsychology community clinic. Students are able to build basic clinical skills (including interviewing and interventions) as well as skills and experience in psychological and neuropsychological test selection, scoring, interpretation and communication of results during feedback sessions and case conferences, and report writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

The Unit also introduces students to basic counselling skills and interviewing techniques. Students will also be taught a decision-making model to aid in their application of the APS Code of Ethics and Practice Guidelines. In addition, students will gain an increased understanding of their professional responsibilities, as well as the primary role of AHPRA and the Psychology Board of Australia.</p><p>This is an ungraded pass/ungraded fail unit and therefore the weighting % in the assessment items section is only indicative.<br></p></p></pre></p>

Where students cannot attend (or have not attended) the full required activities or classes, they are expected to notify the unit coordinators to provide an adequate explanation and documentation (such as a medical certificate in the event of illness) explaining their absence or lateness. A failure to attend without adequate explanation and documented evidence of illness or other impeding factors beyond one's personal control will result in failing the unit in which the class/activity was missed. Note that even where an adequate explanation and documented evidence are supplied, a student will still fail the unit if they have not attended a sufficient proportion of the unit. A "sufficient proportion of the unit" is normally defined as at least 80%.&nbsp;</p><p>-A unit schedule of all classes is available on LMS (see clinical psychology/clinical neuropsychology internal practicum LMS organisation site 2023).</p><p>1) Clinic Meeting (11-lpm each Wednesday) -[Dr Lisa Saulsman]- Attendance at these weekly meetings in the Robin Winkler Clinic is mandatory in first semester only for Neuropsychology 5538 students, but they are welcome to still come in second semester to listen to the student case presentations if they are interested in clinical psychology.</p><p>2) There is a Friday workshop schedule associated with this Unit in Semester 1, and attendance at these workshops is mandatory unless otherwise indicated. Contact the clinical supervisor for further details after allocation to Paediatric or Adult stream for first placement rotation.</p><p>3) Students must also attend the Preparation for Placement classes [Carmela Pestell] in the first 5 weeks of semester (Tuesday 9.30am-lpm, RWC) and trainees cannot see clients until these classes are complete (early April) and completed quizzes have been submitted.</p><p>4)Students are required to attend weekly individual and group supervision sessions with their nominated Supervisor(s), with times to be arranged depending on availability of supervisor/students and their allocated modules. Students must notify the Unit Coordinator(s) and their Supervisor in advance if they are unable to attend class, Clinic Meeting or supervision sessions.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
