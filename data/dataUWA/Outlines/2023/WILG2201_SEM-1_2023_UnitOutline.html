Enrolments in WIL units are subject to approval by the University. A student who withdraws from a WIL placement after confirmation of placement with the host organisation will be declared to have failed the unit unless the School is satisfied that there were exceptional circumstances to justify withdrawal.</td>

Firstly, it gives you an opportunity to put theory into practice and develop an awareness of workplace culture and expectations. Secondly, you will further enhance your ‘transferable’ skills such as communication, teamwork, email and report-writing skills, punctuality, and attendance. Thirdly, an internship is your opportunity to develop a practical appreciation of your chosen career and enhance your future employment prospects. Finally, your internship is an opportunity for an employer to evaluate your potential as a future employee. Research shows that students who undertake a practicum are significantly more likely to be offered vacation work or employment upon graduation.</p><p class="">WILG2201 can be taken in your academic program as an elective unit.&nbsp;</p><p class="">If you are interested in completing a WIL unit, log into UWA's online placement management system 'SONIA' [LINK: <a href='https://placements.uwa.edu.au/School.aspx?SchoolId=22' target='_blank' >https://placements.uwa.edu.au/School.aspx?SchoolId=22</a>] use your Pheme details to log in and submit an Expression of Interest (EOI).</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>WILG2201 is unlike any other unit that you have taken in your degree to date as it provides you with an opportunity to undertake a minimum of 100 hours of paid and/or unpaid employment in an actual work environment under the guidance of an external supervisor within your host organisation along with the support of an academic advisor from UWA. Thus, by its very nature, WILG2201 will provide you with a learning experience that is uniquely yours and different from the experiences of other students in your degree program.</p><p>In terms of having achieved the learning outcomes for WILG2201, you will be able to:</p><p>(1) apply communication and interpersonal skills to a working situation;</p><p>(2) demonstrate initiative and, where required by the host supervisor, the ability to work independently;</p><p>(3) negotiate and plan a proposal and prepare a final report;</p><p>(4) perform tasks set by an employer to a satisfactory standard; and</p><p>(5) reflect and report on your experience in the workplace.</p><p>As indicated by the above, WILG2201 places primary responsibility upon you for the achievement of these learning outcomes. Whilst the host organisation, host supervisor, and academic coordinator will contribute to the quality of your internship experience, your commitment to the placement is of the greatest significance in achieving those outcomes.</p><p>WILG2201: How is it arranged and undertaken?</p><p>The Practicum Placement Officer will manage you through the process of obtaining a placement for your internship. Given differing degree requirements; the number of units (points) you have completed prior to seeking to enrol in WILG2201, the elective and broadening units already completed and your academic status, it is important that ensure that you have met all requirements before seeking to enrol in WILG2201.</p><p>Practicum placement opportunities that match your personal and professional interests and career aspirations can be identified from:<br></p><p>Advertised placements</p><p>A number of placement projects or internships may be advertised by UWA (e.g., through UWA's UniHub or selectively targeted emails) and interested students are encouraged to apply. Depending on the number of applications, it may be necessary to shortlist students. In such a case, a selection process will be undertaken and successful candidates will be invited to enrol in WILG2201 for the purposes of undertaking their practicum placement with that host organisation.</p><p>Self-sourced (i.e., self-arranged) placement</p><p>Students are also able to nominate their own project or internship. The Practicum Placement Officer will assess each self-sourced placement proposal and decide if it is suitable. Students should contact the Practicum Placement Officer as early as possible to discuss their ideas for a potential self-arranged placement. Significant preparatory work must be undertaken before a self-arranged placement can be approved and students must allow sufficient time to ensure that all stages of the approval process are completed in time for the practicum to be completed during the teaching period it is to be undertaken.</p><p>Students intending to arrange their own placement should be mindful of the following guidelines:</p><p>• placements must involve work that requires a sufficiently high skill level to be appropriate to the student’s level of study;</p><p>• placements must involve at least a minimum of 100 hours of work;</p><p>• placements can be for paid and or unpaid work;</p><p>• placements should not generally be in the form of standard casual/part-time/full-time employment and</p><p>• placement projects and work experience activities should contribute to the solution of a problem identified by the organisation or involve investigating alternatives or possible courses of action for the host organisation.</p><p>Internships</p><p>Internships are offered by organisations in the for-profit, not-for-profit, and public sectors. As internships typically have no specific project upon which the practicum is undertaken, they provide interns with an opportunity of experiencing what employment with the host organisation might be like upon graduation. Thus, for both the host organisation and intern, multiple employment outcomes emerge: ranging from demonstrating to the host how valuable a contribution has been made by the intern and, for the intern, how well the work experience matches their academic, personal, and professional expectations and aspirations. In assessing whether or not an internship is suitable for you, consider if the internship allows you to:</p><p>• critically evaluate and apply discipline-specific knowledge in a professional work environment;</p><p>• apply your communication and interpersonal skills to a professional working situation;</p><p>• negotiate, plan and prepare a proposal and make a final report on the internship that is related to your chosen major(s);</p><p>• critically reflect and report on your experience in the workplace;</p><p>• appreciate the skills you need for a successful transition to the workplace and</p><p>• identify the strengths and weaknesses in your preparation for graduate employment.</p><p>Thus, based on your own research and the practicum opportunities identified, complete the Expression of Interest (EOI) in UWA's online placement management system 'SONIA' [LINK: <a href='https://placements.uwa.edu.au/School.aspx?SchoolId=22' target='_blank' >https://placements.uwa.edu.au/School.aspx?SchoolId=22</a>] where you will be asked to upload a resume and a covering letter that identifies yourself and your motivations for enrolling in WILG2201.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that you cannot self enrol in WILG2201 through Student Connect, once you have completed all administrative requirements the Practicum Placements Officer will action your enrolment. Placements must be approved prior to commencement by the Practicum Placements Officer otherwise you cannot be granted credit for WILG2201 even though you have undertaken a placement.</p><p>Plan: Developing your Placement</p><p>Once you have secured provisional approval for your placement, you will need to address the planning phase of your professional practicum placement. For example, there are a number of administrative matters to address that may have a significant impact on your ability to embark on your practicum.</p><p>If you are undertaking a placement that requires you to travel, either domestically or internationally, you will need to make plans for travel and accommodation. Once you have planned your travel and accommodation arrangements, you will need to inform the University of your travel dates and accommodation arrangements along with emergency contact numbers.</p><p>You must have insurance while you complete your placement in order to protect you, your host, and the University in the event of accidents and other insurable risks. Where you are not covered by your host’s workers' compensation and personal liability insurance, as would be the case if you are engaged in paid employment, you will need to have a Certificate of Insurance issued by the University. Note that where your insurance is arranged by the University, a separate Certificate of Insurance must be issued for each of your placements if you are undertaking more than one placement.</p><p>Student placement insurance cover policy outlines the protection available to UWA students while on course-required or relevant work experience and placements. UWA’s Insurance indemnifies the provider of work experience for liability arising out of any negligent act, error, or omission on the part of a practicum student. However, this indemnity does not extend to any liability, cost, or expense arising out of any negligent act or omission of the provider or any of its employees, contractors, agents, invitees, or trespassers.</p><p>A portfolio of insurance policies covers a student while on work placement in an approved Practicum Placement: these policies are the group personal accident plan; public liability; medical malpractice (where appropriate) and corporate travel (when placement occurs interstate or overseas). Furthermore, you should consider if you need to include additional insurance to cover your travel and accommodation costs before, during, or subsequent to your approved Practicum Placement. For a Certificate of Insurance to be issued, an email request to the UWA Insurance Team from the Practicum Placement Officer, Academic Coordinator, or relevant head of school or dean must be submitted for this to occur. Such an email must include a statement of support or be included as an attached letter. When you go on placement, you must ensure that you take a copy of your Certificate(s) of Insurance with you and have your emergency contact numbers with you at all times.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As you may be eligible for a travel grant sourced from the University or an external funding body, you should ensure that you allow sufficient time for lodging an application for such financial support, in having it assessed and potentially approved.</p><p>Finally, planning for your practicum placement is a key step in achieving the best possible work-integrated learning experience. Think about the roles and responsibilities you will undertake through your placement and reflect on how you expect this work-integrated learning experience contributes to your learning and future career aspirations. If you secure a placement through an externally sourced practicum, you may have less opportunity for developing your own roles and responsibilities. Nevertheless, it is still important for you to have a clear understanding of your own roles and responsibilities and to reflect on their relationship to your academic, professional and personal aspirations.</p><p>Complete: All required Practicum Pre-Placement activities</p><p>To be permitted to undertake a Professional Practicum Placement, you may be required to engage in one or more pre-placement activities.</p><p>The Pre-placement Program</p><p>To ensure that you are ready to commence your internship, you will be required to complete the online Pre-placement Program (PPP). The three modules that comprise the PPP will help you make the most of your internship experience by providing you with information and guidance for ensuring that, whilst you are on placement, you are safe and are able to perform your role in a professional manner, including in being able to respond appropriately to positive and negative feedback</p><p>Career development workshops</p><p>To ensure that you realise the career-related outcomes of your practicum, you will be required to complete a minimum of two career-related workshops offered by UWA Careers or other approved providers. For example, you can register for Career workshops such as Resume and Cover Letters; Addressing Selection Criteria; Linked-in; Employer Presentations; and Industry Up-date events.</p><p>Execute: Undertake your Internship Placement</p><p>As you commence your placement with your practicum host, it is important to remember some fundamental guidelines about what a placement is, and what it is not:</p><p>• A placement is not simply ‘free labour’ for your host organisation; it must provide a genuine learning experience for you and an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills you obtained from your studies and to further develop those skills.</p><p>• In commencing your placement, you should have a clear written or verbal description of the activities that are to be undertaken during the placement. This description will be broadly detailed in the Confirmation of Placement document signed by you, your host supervisor, and the Practicum Placements Officer. The Academic Coordinator will be available to provide advice if necessary.</p><p>• Once you have your placement roles and responsibilities established, you can start work.</p><p>On-placement activities</p><p>During your placement, please note the following:</p><p>• As stated above, your professional practicum placement is not just ‘work experience’, it is an opportunity for you to critically reflect on your learning and how it intersects with the ‘real’ world. To ensure that you maintain adequate documentary evidence to draw upon when drafting your Practicum and Reflection Report, it is highly recommended that you maintain a daily or weekly diary in which you record those things that have interested, surprised, and/or frustrated you. Using the STAR Analysis tool will help you make sense of some of your experiences and contribute to your ability to provide evidence of relevant workplace skills that you have developed.</p><p>• It is important to act with a high level of professionalism and integrity throughout your placement. Remember that when you are on placement, you are also representing your fellow UWA students, the academic program you are studying, and the wider University. Hence, completing timesheets, interim and post-completion online surveys, and where appropriate, interim achievement and planning documents contribute to a professional approach.</p><p>• Placements provide you with an opportunity to develop a relationship with a potential employer. However, please note that there are no guarantees that you will be offered employment simply by undertaking your placement.</p><p>Undertaking a practicum placement can be a stressful experience. Whilst a moderate amount of stress is a normal feature of working life, if you need extra support, the University offers a wide range of health and well-being support services that can restore and balance your life. Information on these comprehensive health and well-being support services can be accessed from: <a href='http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/experience/health' target='_blank' >http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/experience/health</a>.</p><p>Practicum and Reflection Report</p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;">You are required to complete your Practicum and Reflection Report in accord with the specific requirements for your internship and upload a final version of your Practicum and Reflection Report report to LMS</span><strong>. </strong>As the Practicum and Reflection Report is the only formal document that provides evidence of your achievement of the learning outcomes for WILG2201 Professional Experience Practicum, it is the critical task for you to complete in determining the academic outcome (i.e., pass or fail) of your enrolment in the unit.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite your best efforts, you may find that adverse changes in your health or well-being have negatively impacted the completion of your practicum placement and/or report. In these circumstances, you may be eligible for ‘special consideration’ which may take the form of an extension for the completion of your practicum placement hours and/or the Practicum and Reflection Report. If applicable, UniAccess may be able to provide advice and to assist you to make an application to your school office. However, you must read the conditions attaching to the granting of special consideration before lodging the Application for Special Consideration.&nbsp;If your host organisation makes an adjustment to your internship, after the placement details have been confirmed, you may not be able to complete your required assessments by the due dates listed in the unit outline. Please email the WIL Team who will contact your host to verify the placement adjustment and provide supporting evidence for your special consideration application. Your SC application must be submitted online no later than 3 working days from the due date of your assessment item, however, you are encouraged to submit your application as soon as possible.  </p><p>Links to UWA’s policy on the granting of special consideration are as follows: <a href='http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/course/exams/consideration' target='_blank' >http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/course/exams/consideration</a> and <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP11%2F23.&nbsp' target='_blank' >http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP11%2F23.&nbsp</a>;</p><p>Please note that your Practicum and Reflection Report must be consistent with the requirements set for this assessment task. Further information is available from the Practicum and Reflection Report Guidelines document that can be downloaded from LMS.<br></p><p>Teaching and Learning evaluation</p><p>You may be asked to complete Student Evaluation of Learning and Teaching (SELT). The SELT is completed online and is a university-wide survey and deals with the unit and the teacher. You will receive an email from the SELT office inviting you to complete the SELT when it is activated. We encourage you to complete the forms as your feedback is extremely important and can be used to make changes to the unit or lecturing style when appropriate.</p></p></pre></p>

UWA prefers the APA 7 referencing type, unless otherwise stated by the unit coordinator. You can find resources on using APA 7 on the University Library website: <a href='https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/apa' target='_blank' >https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/apa</a>.</p><p>The EndNote software package is a really good system for building up a database of references. Not everyone will want to invest the time in using this system but you should consider it if you intend to build up resource materials or plan to undertake extensive research in a particular area. The library staff have also developed a tutoring package: ‘A Quick Guide to Using EndNote’ which provides the basics for using EndNote with an essay <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote' target='_blank' >http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote</a></p><p>Acknowledging Sources of Information and the Business School Policy on Plagiarism</p><p>Student Services provides an online plagiarism portal that includes a definition of plagiarism and a link to FAQ www.studentservices.uwa.edu.au/ss/learning/online_services/plagiarism_portal ‘Turnitin' Originality Checking and Plagiarism Prevention is used in the Faculty to allow both educators and their students check written work for improper citation or misappropriated content.

However, interns must follow a workflow process that enables them to enrol in, undertake and report upon their practicum placement in the teaching period that best matches the timing of their placement.</p><p>Closing dates for lodging an Expression of Interest (EOI) in undertaking a practicum will be published and, unless extenuating circumstances exist, no late submission of an EOI will be accepted. EOI's are to be submitted via UWA's online placement management system 'SONIA' [LINK: <a href='https://placements.uwa.edu.au/School.aspx?SchoolId=22' target='_blank' >https://placements.uwa.edu.au/School.aspx?SchoolId=22</a>].</p><p>Once their enrolment in WILG2201 is approved, a student will engage in the planning and pre-placement activities related to their internship, undertake a minimum of 100 hours of work experience and complete their Practicum Portfolio. The Practicum Portfolio simply comprises all of the tasks you have undertaken and documents that you have created, of which the Practicum and Reflection Report is a significant component. Whilst it is envisaged that all of these tasks will be undertaken prior to and during the enrolled teaching period, the timing and taking of the work experience may affect when all requirements are to be completed. If your host organisation makes an adjustment to your internship, after the placement details have been confirmed, you may not be able to complete your required assessments by the due dates listed in the unit outline. Please email the WIL Team who will contact your host to verify the placement adjustment and will provide supporting evidence for your special consideration application. Your SC application must be submitted online no later than 3 working days from the due date of your assessment item, however, you are encouraged to submit your SC application as soon as you are aware an adjustment has been made.  <br></p><p>The UWA Careers Centre develops students’ awareness, capacity, and skills to manage their careers and make a successful transition from academic studies to employment. Students enrolled in WILG2201 are required to complete at least two (2) career-related workshops either conducted by the Careers Centre or an approved external provider. Registration for Careers Centre workshops can be completed via UniHub: <a href='https://unihub.uwa.edu.au/' target='_blank' >https://unihub.uwa.edu.au/</a></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>

                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
