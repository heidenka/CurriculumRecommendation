As an unattached elective, this unit does not provide the first step of a pathway to a major in Indonesian. The unit aims to help students to achieve 'social proficiency' in Indonesian or Level 2+ of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (Elaine Wylie and D. E. Ingram, Griffith University, 1995). 

Students explore social, cultural and political issues, both prescribed and of their own choice. This is done through exposure to a wide range of authentic, contemporary Indonesian language material, including fiction, newspapers, radio and TV/film. Students are required to use internet resources to keep themselves up-to-date on the social and political changes taking place in Indonesian society. They develop reading, writing and translation skills in official, colloquial and literary styles. They also participate in conversation classes and are exposed to a variety of recorded material. In addition, they work on language development (structure and grammar), both in a prescribed way and also in response to questions about the texts.</td>

Monday class 1: Speaking, Listening and Language Development</p><p>In this class you will be encouraged to develop your conversational and listening skills through various activities. This class also aims to develop your grasp of Indonesian grammar through focussing on particular language structures each week. Oral activities (e.g. role plays, interviews, discussion) will occur with the aim of developing your confidence and competence.</p><p>For this class there will be some written exercises which will be assessed.</p><p>   Speaking; Culture and Society</p><p>In this class we will explore aspects of Indonesian culture and society. Topics could include media, religion, literature, art, film, music, ethnic groups, history (e.g. ancient empires, the Dutch occupation, revolution, Japanese occupation, various political or artistic figures), social issues (e.g.  crime, prostitution, AIDS, narcotics, gangs), sport or current political issues such as elections, corruption scandals, deforestation, natural disasters, terrorism, floods, earthquakes, conflicts in Sulawesi, Papua and elsewhere.  In some weeks the topic will be provided, while in others you will decide the topic as a class.  You will be expected to research each week's topic using a mix of Indonesian and English language materials.  (For contemporary topics the internet will be especially useful.)  Everyone will be expected to contribute to the discussion topic each week.  You will receive participation mark as part of your assessment.  Therefore you must demonstrate that you have prepared for the discussion.  </p><p>In this section of the unit you will also be required to read a piece of Indonesian fiction (in translation) which will form the basis of your 1000 word assignment written in Indonesian.  Assignment is due to be submitted by 11pm Monday Week 10.  You will also be presenting a 10-15 minute talk in Indonesian about your chosen novel/short story/play from Week 10.  These presentations will be assessed.</p><p>2. Wednesday class 2 and Thursday class 3: Reading, Writing and Translation</p><p>This class is devoted to a set reading program (see the Study Program).  Preparation of these texts means: reading them for understanding and being prepared to talk about the text, what it says about Indonesian society, what you think of it and why.  Some texts have questions which require answers.  For those without questions you will be expected to come up with questions in class for discussion.  It is essential that this preparation is completed before class and that notes on the material are brought to class for discussion.  This preparation of the texts, and preparation and answering of questions is assessable.</p><p>There will also be a translation component in this class, from Week 8. After a trial run there will be two translation exercises that will be assessed.</p><p>There will be at least one short test in this class on new vocabulary and grammar covered in the period since the previous test. The others will be completed online. These are all assessed.&nbsp;</p><p>Non-contact or home study consists of the following:</p><p>1. Preparation for class</p><p>In addition to you using your common sense to prepare adequately and appropriately, the homework section of your weekly Study Program lists homework tasks for each week.  </p><p>2. Major Assignment</p><p>You will be required to submit one 1000 word essay in Indonesian.  (See details page 4.)  Please note that this and all written work should be typed and double spaced to make it easy for the marker to write comments/corrections.</p><p>3. Additional Study and Practice</p><p>Take every opportunity to practise your Indonesian and to listen to it being spoken!  There are many effective learning techniques (see Information on language learning strategies in Helpful Websites).  You can watch Indonesian TV and listen to listen to Indonesian radio via the internet (see Helpful Websites). Also watch Indonesian films on Netflix, etc. Try making friends with a native speaker (there are plenty on campus!). Join an Indonesian chat room. Invite Indonesians to become your friends on Facebook.  Read aloud to yourself. Or just 'omong-omong' to keep yourself fluent and thinking!  Varied learning methods are helpful and they avoid monotony!  If  you  are  having  troubles  with  some  aspect  of  the  language,  let  your  tutor  know.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
