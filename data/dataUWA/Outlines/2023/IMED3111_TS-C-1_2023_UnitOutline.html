                                    <td>In this unit, science, clinical and professional content will be presented longitudinally, built around the core clinical conditions and presentations. 

Students cover the foundational concepts of the biomedical sciences of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, genetics, immunology, haematology, microbiology, anatomical pathology and pharmacology. Case-based learning built around the core conditions and presentations will illustrate clinically relevant aspects of bioscience and introduce principles of clinical reasoning. Communication skills and the clinical skills of medical history-taking and physical examination are introduced in a structured manner, allowing development of professional behaviours and understanding of the patient perspective and of patient-centred care. The concepts of epidemiology, medical research and evidence-based practice are introduced along with the opportunity to discuss the main issues in social determinants of health, global health, mental health, healthcare systems and health economics. Students have opportunities to develop their information literacy skills as applied to medicine. Introduction to professional aspects of medical practice includes professional behaviours, medical law and ethics, leadership and teamwork, collaborative practice, educational theory and practice, diversity within medicine, and Aboriginal health.

Students must abide by the Professional Behaviour Procedure set in out in the Workplace-based placements.

The content and pedagogy of this unit is designed to meet and deliver toward AMC standards and to meet the conversion requirement.</td>

Students cover the foundational concepts of the biomedical sciences of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, genetics, immunology, haematology, microbiology, pathology and pharmacology. Case-based learning built around the core conditions and presentations will illustrate clinically relevant aspects of bioscience and introduce principles of clinical reasoning. Communication skills and the clinical skills of medical history- taking and physical examination are introduced in a structured manner, allowing development of professional behaviours and understanding of the patient perspective and of patient-centred care. The concepts of epidemiology, medical research and evidence-based practice are introduced along with the opportunity to discuss the main issues in social determinants of health, global health, mental health, healthcare systems and health economics. Students have opportunities to develop their information literacy skills as applied to medicine. Introduction to professional aspects of medical practice includes professional behaviours, medical law and ethics, leadership and teamwork, collaborative practice, educational theory and practice, diversity within medicine, and Aboriginal health.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
