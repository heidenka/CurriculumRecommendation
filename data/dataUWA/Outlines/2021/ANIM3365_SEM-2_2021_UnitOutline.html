                                    <td>This unit covers the broad area of behavioural ecology—how an animal's behaviour is adapted to its physical and social environment. The unit comprises five broad sections: (1) foundations of behavioural ecology; (2) sexual selection; (3) perception and signaling; (4) kinship, conflict, cooperation and (5) predator-prey interactions.  The unit integrates these themes within an evolutionary framework that explores individual plasticity and the genetic basis of behaviour, along with a strong mechanistic basis of how perceptual systems work (e.g. vision which will set limits to behavioural capacity). Lectures are complemented by a practical component to develop skills in review and critique of the primary literature and the development of research skills. During a literature review exercise, students are guided through tutorials to locate and read original journal articles, make use of standard reference texts and online resources, and understand basic ideas and models in behavioural ecology. Students also undertake a research project to develop skills in experimental design, data collection and analysis. In both exercises (literature review and research project), students communicate their findings through formal scientific reports and short PowerPoint presentations.</td>

The unit comprises five modules: (1) Foundations of Behavioural Ecology; (2) Sexual Selection; (3) Predator-Prey Interactions (4) Perception and Signalling; and (5) Kinship, Conflict, Cooperation and Social Behaviour. The unit is taught by a team of lecturers who combine expertise in all of these areas. The unit integrates these themes within an evolutionary framework that explores the adaptive basis of behaviour, individual plasticity and the genetic basis of behaviour, ecological interactions governing social, sexual and antipredator behaviours, along with a strong mechanistic understanding of how perceptual systems work. Lectures are complemented by a practical component to develop skills in review and critique of the primary literature and the development of research skills. During a literature review exercise, students are guided through tutorials to locate and read original journal articles, make use of standard reference texts and online resources, and understand basic ideas and models in behavioural ecology. Students also undertake a research project to develop skills in experimental design, data collection and analysis. In both exercises (literature review and research project), students communicate their findings through formal scientific reports and short PowerPoint presentations.</p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>Our goal in this unit it to put YOU at the centre of your learning. We have designed a variety of engaging learning activities that will encourage you to learn collaboratively with your peers, tutors and lecturers. This means that you ultimately set the pace of your learning, both inside and outside the classroom. This approach supports your development as individuals but also empowers you to solve conceptual or practical problems outside the ‘formal’ learning environment by working collaboratively (i.e. not exclusively through a one-way stream of information delivered as part of a lecture). Our teaching styles recognise that you have individual learning needs and capabilities, and our approaches to teaching aim to break down perceived barriers among students and teaching staff. See Unit Structure (below) for further details of these learning activities.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Unit Structure</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>There are two lecture slots each week. These will be filled either with formal lectures or interactive lecture tutorials. Where we conduct lecture tutorials, a recording of the formal lecture will be made available to you one week prior to the scheduled class. When we run these lecture tutorials, you must view recorded lectures, read any assigned reading material, and where advised complete questionnaires/learning tasks before each class. The lecture tutorials will not work if you have not engaged with these tasks beforehand. Lecture tutorials provide an opportunity to think more deeply into the topics covered in the formal lecture, discuss key topics in an informal and friendly environment, receive and provide feedback from/to peers, and interact with teaching staff. The lecture tutorials also typically provide an opportunity to understand how we set exam questions and how to construct an appropriate answer. Whether we are running standard lectures or lecture tutorials, lecturers are always happy to answer questions, so please interrupt us if you do not understand something or require further information on a topic. There is no set textbook for this unit; you will be guided to specific readings associated with each lecture and during discussion groups. A reading list for lectures and lecture tutorials will be added to the Unit’s Blackboard site and updated as the semester progresses. The final theory exam will draw on material covered in lectures, lecture tutorials and the core reading material set for each lecture.

Lectures are complemented by a practical component to help you develop skills in review and critique of the primary literature, data collection, statistical analysis, data interpretation and communication. 

Specific details of the assessment tasks are provided in the information sheets in LMS (Assessments). Please refer to this material for key dates associated with each assessment task, along with timetable in LMS for details of assessment dates or when online resources associated with practical work are available (e.g. pre-lab videos, online statistics tuition workshop).</p></p></pre></p>

If there are only two authors please list both, i.e. Able and Cabbott 2000. The order for references within parentheses in the text should be chronological and then alphabetical. For works by the exact same author(s) in the same year, append a lowercase a, b, c, etc. to the year of publication. If the works differ slightly in names, provide enough surnames to distinguish the one group from the other. The reference list should conform to the following styles: Journal article Author AB, Author CD, Author EF. 2001a. Title of article. J Hered. 60:128-132. Paper in a conference proceedings Author AB, editor. 2001b. Article title. Name of conference; YYYY MMM DD-DD; location. City, State or Country of publication: Publisher's name. p. 137-180.

The unit is organised into five modules. After each module, we will provide a short revision quiz for self-assessment purposes. These quizzes do not form part of the formal assessment of the unit but are designed to embed core concepts from the lectures and make revision fun and ultimately more rewarding than simply memorising a series of ‘facts’. Indeed, we do not test factual recall in this unit, but rather we encourage you to think through and solve problems. Problem solving exercises form a major component of the final exam (see below) and to do well in these exercises you will need to think about concepts covered in lectures. Quizzes will help with this; they are ‘interactive’, in the sense that you will receive feedback on your answers (whether correct or incorrect), and may point you towards resources that will further your understanding of these concepts. So please take the opportunity to participate in these online quizzes and contact your lecturers if you require any support. <br></p><p>
Computing and software:
You will need a computer with basic statistical software (Excel, possibly R if you are confident with the program, or any statistical package that can handle basic statistics). If you attend the practical statistics workshop, you will need to bring a laptop loaded with your statistical software of choice.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
