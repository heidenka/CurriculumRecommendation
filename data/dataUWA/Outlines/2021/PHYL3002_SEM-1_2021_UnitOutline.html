The unit builds on the material covering cardiovascular and respiratory function in Level 2 PHYL2001 Physiology of Human Body Systems. The unit further develops students' laboratory techniques for physiological measurement. Human experimental work covers non-invasive cardiovascular and respiratory measurements. Ethical aspects of human experimentation are covered. 

Finally the unit has a focus on data recording, analysis and presentation skills including statistical analysis, the graphical presentation of data, and communication in the form of scientific poster presentations. The unit has a major focus on visual communication of data and critical information literacy in the form of a research poster which students must pose, based on a published paper. The theme of visual communication is continued with the ongoing submission of professional quality figures and graphics using the data generated in laboratory classes. The unit also reinforces aspects of teamwork and interpersonal skills in both experimental work and communication.</td>

The unit builds on the material covering cardiovascular and respiratory function in Level 2 PHYL2001 Physiology of Human Body Systems. The unit further develops students' laboratory techniques for physiological measurement. Human experimental work covers non-invasive cardiovascular and respiratory measurements. Ethical aspects of human experimentation are covered.</p><p>Finally the unit has a focus on data recording, analysis and presentation skills including statistical analysis, the graphical presentation of data, and communication in the form of scientific poster presentations. The unit has a major focus on visual communication of data and critical information literacy in the form of a research poster which students must pose, based on a published paper. The theme of visual communication is continued with the ongoing submission of professional quality figures and graphics using the data generated in laboratory classes. The unit also reinforces aspects of teamwork and interpersonal skills in both experimental work and communication.</p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content.

Lectures in the unit cover the core physiology concepts of the unit, how the respiratory and cardiovascualr systems opperate. all lectures are online only and there will be no live lectures in 2021. Skills in human physiological experiments, data analysis and communication are, mostly, taught using tutorials and lab classes. All labs are on humans meaning the student use each other as the test subjects. Lab classes are compulsory and student cannot submit a report for a lab class if they did not attend the lab, unless the student has an approved special consideration. Tutorials cover the skills content such as data analysis and safety aspects of human experimentation they do not focus on the lecture content. Some supplemental video lectures are included on LMS to help students with data analysis and statistics, mostly covering practical isues like how to do an ANOVA test on Excel. In PHYL3002 the communication skills focus is on the scientific poster presentation an expanding part of real scientific conferences and a skill transportable to simmilar visual based presentations in other areas. Poster communication is very visual with the figures and gaphics doing much of the work and very little text compaired to scientific papers. <br></p><p>The assignments in this unit are structured around a scientific conference poster session. Each of the first 3 lab classes has a report that is a part of a scientific poster and over the three reports covers all aspects of a poster's content. The major assignment is a group project to present a published paper as if it was your experiment in a simulated conference poster session. Report marks are significantly influenced by communications skills, in this case the visual communications skills of making professional level figures and graphs. Student's knowledge of the subject is mostly assessed with the exam. The assignments test what you can do the exam test what you know.</p></p></pre></p>

Lectures and tutorials are not compulsory; however, the tutorials were added because students felt they needed more help and have reported that the tutorials have helped with the reports and final poster assignment. If a student cannot attend their normal lab class but can attend a different session e.g. cannot do Wed am but can make the Thru am class that week then, on a once only basis, the student can attend the other time slot but should contact the demonstrator of their normal class to let them know. If you are sick and miss a lab or must miss a class of other good reason you need to obtain a special consideration from the faculty and your due date can then be extended.</p><p>Failure to attend a lab class means that you cannot submit the report for that lab and so loose the marks it contributes to the continuous assessment. Failure to attend the seminar (poster session) also means loss of the marks for that part of the continuous assessment (a lot of marks). If a student is sick or otherwise has a special consideration and cannot attend their poster session, they will typically be given the group’s mark (the poster presentation is a group report) if a special consideration is granted by faculty. </p><p>Attendance at the workshop, like the tutorials, is not compulsory. The workshop is about statistical analysis and how to use Excel to extend the range of statistical problems you can work with. Like the tutorials the workshop was added because students requested more practical training on using statistics, so it is recommended you attend.</p><p>For 2021 we will take attendance at all live face to face events for COVID tracking even if the class is not compulsory. </p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
