The main objective is for students to attain 'transactional proficiency' in Indonesian or Level 1+ as described in the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (Elaine Wylie and D. E. Ingram, Griffith University, 1995). Students memorise model conversations based on routine activities such as visiting the doctor, looking for a house and being welcomed as a guest. They thereby gain practical experience and confidence in speaking as well as learning about social conventions. Students' listening and comprehension skills are extended by studying extracts of authentic Indonesian films. They are also exposed to short articles taken from the Indonesian media in order to develop reading skills and vocabulary. Students are given a workshop on writing essays in Indonesian in order to learn some of the conventions of formal writing.</td>

Note that although there are two codes for this unit, all students are taught together and there is no difference in the assessment of the two groups.  </p><p>The main objective is for students to attain transactional proficiency in Indonesian. Students memorise model conversations based on routine activities such as visiting the doctor, looking for a house and being welcomed as a guest. They gain practical experience and confidence in speaking as well as learning about social conventions. Students' listening and comprehension skills are extended by studying extracts of authentic Indonesian films. They are also exposed to short articles taken from the Indonesian media in order to develop reading skills and vocabulary. Students are given a workshop on writing essays in Indonesian in order to learn some of the conventions of formal writing.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>A blended model with face to face classes and an online component.&nbsp;There are various activities, such as spontaneous conversations, speaking, reading comprehension, viewing and listening.</p><p>Your progress will be assessed by tests.  Take careful note of when these are held as they are not all held at the same time. As these tests are a major component of your assessment, you are required to do the tests when they are held.  You will not be permitted to take a test at another time unless you were ill on the day of the test and present a medical certificate or, because of exceptional circumstances, you have obtained the agreement of the lecturer. The mark awarded to each test is 0 – 100%.</p><p>You will be asked to submit three 400 word passages through the course of the semester. These will all be corrected and assessed. You will be assessed on the content of the written work (30%); structure / cohesion of the written work (10%); linguistic correctness e.g. grammar, syntax, language structure (20%); range and sophistication of the language used, including vocabulary choice, affixation (20%); presentation (10%); and referencing (10%). The mark awarded is 0 – 100%. However, marks will be deducted for late assignments (5% of the assignment mark per day late) and no assignments will be accepted after 7 days.<br></p><p>Also, you will be asked to do two oral presentations in the course of the semester. The first will be in Week 8 and will be done together with a partner in the form of an invented dialogue. This is not assessed but will be good preparation for the more formal presentations which you will do in Week 11 and 12. These presentations, which are worth 5% of your marks, should focus on a topic of interest to you and should include some handouts or visual aids (PowerPoint if you like). The presentation should last for about 6 minutes, followed by questions about your topic by other students and your lecturer. You need to answer these questions. Show that you know the topic well and you are able to use your Indonesian well. You will be assessed on the content of the presentation (20%); the fluency (20%); the correctness and sophistication of the language used, e.g. grammar, vocabulary range, syntax (50%); and interaction with and interest to audience (10%). The mark awarded is 0-100%. The mark awarded is 0-100%.</p><p>In written examination, you will be assessed on your writing skills, either in reading comprehension and answering questions, writing short conversations, paragraphs, essays, translations, or completing sentences, etc. You need to read the instructions for each part of the examination carefully. The mark awarded is 0-100%.</p></p></pre></p>

It will flag particular aspects on which you should focus in your learning, e.g. vocabulary, structure, topic and context, and cultural nuances.  It will include listening and pronunciation practice and will enable you to ask about any aspects of your learning.</p><p><strong>Session II</strong>   ( Hari Senin 2 ) </p><p>	This class will enable you to practise the language elements on which we are focusing each week by interacting with others in a range of language practice and language development exercises, e.g. guided conversations, interviews, role-plays. </p><p>	Some mini tests will be conducted in this session. </p><p><strong>Session III</strong>   ( Hari Rabu ) </p><p>	In this class you will be provided with further opportunities to enable you to develop your language skills.  These activities will range from oral activities encouraging spontaneity in using Indonesian, to more formal reading and writing activities. Some mini tests will be conducted in this session.</p><p><strong>At-Home Study</strong></p><p>1.	<u>Formal Preparation for Contact Sessions</u> (i.e. PR!)</p><p>You will need to prepare all the required exercises and readings listed for each session. It is essential that you prepare for each class in order to derive maximum benefit from the activities.  Preparation must consist of the following and should consist of other activities too:</p><p>•	reading the dialogues, readings and notes</p><p>•	studying vocabulary and memorizing patterns</p><p>•	doing the listed exercises (these will not be marked, we will be discussing them in class, and remember that 10% of your marks is based on ‘class preparation’. The exercises are also vital for the mini tests)</p><p>•	studying (revising) for the mini tests</p><p>•	Write down any questions to ask your lecturer/tutor in class.</p><p><u>2.	Mini Tests</u></p><p>It is very important that you study regularly, for your mini tests from Week 1.  You need to maintain sound study habits throughout the semester. Language learning requires ongoing, steady learning. Studying in bursts now and then places too much strain on the memory and is, therefore, far less efficient than continuous study. </p><p><u>3.	Further Study</u></p><p>Three hours in class a week is not enough. You will need to do additional practice and study because you need to master the content of the unit.  This means understanding and using the language in written (reading, writing) and spoken form (listening, speaking) and using correct grammar, which you must revise regularly.  Varied learning methods are helpful and they avoid monotony!  There are many effective learning techniques, including:</p><p>•	practising with a classmate	}	these activities will help you develop </p><p>•	finding an Indonesian friend	}	spontaneity in conversations. </p><p>•	Brows the very good Bahasa Kita website (Link on unit homepage)</p><p>•	Go through the fantastic step by step Indonesian course with plenty of examples to practice your grammar and listening skills at The Indonesian Way at <a href='http://ipll.manoa.hawaii.edu/ind/tiw/lessons/index.htm' target='_blank' >http://ipll.manoa.hawaii.edu/ind/tiw/lessons/index.htm</a></p><p>•	Watch Indonesian movies and clips on YouTube</p><p>•	Watch Indonesian TV stations (RCTI, TransTV, SCTV, MetroTV, GlobalTV) on <a href='http://www.mivo.tv/' target='_blank' >http://www.mivo.tv/</a></p><p>•	Record and watch Indonesian news on SBS Two @ 6.40am and occasional Indonesian movies on SBS.</p><p>•	Listen to broadcasts in Indonesian on SBS radio www.radio.sbs.com.au/language.php?news=arts&amp;language=Indonesian.</p><p>•	Check out the exercises, grammar explanations and quizzes at this site: <a href='http://www.seasite.niu.edu/Indonesian/TataBahasa' target='_blank' >http://www.seasite.niu.edu/Indonesian/TataBahasa</a></p><p>•	Test your vocab at The Internet TESL Journal site:  <a href='http://iteslj.org/v/in/' target='_blank' >http://iteslj.org/v/in/</a></p><p>•	If you would like additional exercises to do, please ask Ibu Theresia.</p><p>The truth is that in order to speak fluent Indonesian you have to spend time in Indonesia. I would strongly encourage you to plan to incorporate one semester of in-country study in Indonesia in your second or third year of Indonesian. UWA students normally do this extremely popular program through the Australian Consortium for Indonesian In-Country Studies normally known as ACICIS. We will be holding information sessions about this but please feel free to ask Pak David Bourchier about this at any time. Be sure to check out the ACICIS website at www.acicis.uwa.edu.au</p></p></pre></p>

Class attendance is especially important when tests and exams are scheduled because you will not have a second chance without a very good reason.  Failing to attend at other times will result in poor marks for class participation so it is recommended that students attend all classes.  Marks of 0-100% will be awarded for your general participation in all activities, not just for the specific assessment items.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>1.	In accordance with Faculty regulations, any student who does not make satisfactory progress in the course may be excluded from taking the final examination.</p><p>2.	A penalty of 5 per cent of the possible mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays), after which the assigned work is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due. For example, a student, who has submitted a piece of work for an assessment item late by three days and was scored a mark of 45 out of a possible mark of 50, receives after penalty a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day as a penalty for each student from the mark obtained). Where there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied holistically to the assessment item after all tasks have been completed. If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course.</p><p>3.    Students may not submit a piece of work twice, either in the Unit or from other Units. Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total     mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p><p>Supplementary assessment is not available in this unit except in the case of a bachelor’s pass degree student who has obtained a mark of 45 to 49 and is currently enrolled in this unit, and it is the only remaining unit that the student must pass in order to graduate.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
