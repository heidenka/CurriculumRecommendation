                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Apart from acquiring mastery over the disciplinary knowledge taught in your prior studies and graduate degree, WILG5001 Professional Development Practicum A (hereafter WILG5001) and, where eligible, related post-graduate internship units (i.e., WILG5002 Professional Development Practicum B and WILG5003 Professional Development Practicum C) provides you with an opportunity to undertake a work integrated learning experience that complements your academic studies and helps you to prepare for your chosen career upon graduation.</p><p>Undertaking WILG5001 and, where eligible, related post-graduate internship units provides many benefits. Firstly, it gives you an opportunity to put theory into practice and further develop your awareness of workplace culture and expectations. Secondly, you will further enhance your ‘transferable’ skills such as communication, team work, email and report-writing skills, punctuality and attendance. Thirdly, an internship is your opportunity to develop a practical appreciation of your chosen career and enhance your future employment prospects. Finally, your internship placement is an opportunity for an employer to evaluate your potential as a future employee. Research shows that students who undertake a practicum are significantly more likely to be offered vacation work or employment on graduation.</p><p>WILG5001 is to be taken in your academic program as an elective unit. Where eligible, WILG5002 and WILG 5003 are also taken as elective units</p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>WILG5001 is and, where eligible, related post-graduate internship units are,  unlike any other unit that you have taken in your degree to date as it provides you with an opportunity to undertake a minimum of 100 hours of paid and/or unpaid employment per unit in an actual work environment under the guidance of an external supervisor within your host organisation along with the support of an academic advisor from UWA. Thus, by its very nature, WILG5001 will provide you with a learning experience that is uniquely yours and different from the experiences of other students in your degree program.</p><p>In terms of having achieved the learning outcomes for WILG5001 and, where eligible, related post-graduate internship units, you will be able to:</p><p>1. Practice effectively as an emerging professional through teamwork, collegial practice, conflict management and the adoption of appropriate professional conventions, as appropriate to the placement;</p><p>2. Apply communication and interpersonal skills to a working situation;</p><p>3. Apply theoretical knowledge and frameworks in a practical setting and</p><p>4. Reflect on and evaluate their performance in a professional context.</p><p>As indicated by the above, WILG5001 and, where eligible, related post-graduate internship units, place primary responsibility upon you for the achievement of these learning outcomes. Whilst the host organisation, host supervisor and UWA's&nbsp; academic coordinator will contribute to the quality of your internship experience, your commitment to the placement (or internship) is of the greatest significance in achieving those outcomes.</p><p>WILG5001: How is it arranged and undertaken?</p><p>The Practicum Placement Officer for UWA&nbsp; will have managed you through the process for obtaining a work integrated learning placement.</p><p>Undertaking your Practicum Placement</p><p>As you commence your placement with your practicum host, it is important to remember some fundamental guidelines about what a placement is, and what it is not:</p><p>• A placement is not simply ‘free labour’ for your host organisation; it must provide a genuine learning experience for you and an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills you obtained from your studies and to further develop those skills.</p><p>• In commencing your placement, you should have a clear written or verbal description of the activities that are to be undertaken during the placement. This description will be broadly detailed in the Confirmation of Placement document signed by you, your host supervisor and the Practicum Placements Officer. The Academic Coordinator will be available to provide advice if necessary.</p><p>• Once you have your placement roles and responsibilities established, you can start work.</p><p>On-placement activities</p><p>During your placement, please note the following:</p><p>• As stated above, your professional practicum placement is not just ‘work experience’, it is an opportunity for you to critically reflect on your learning and how it intersects with the ‘real’ world. To ensure that you maintain adequate documentary evidence to draw upon when drafting your Practicum Report, it is highly recommended that you maintain a daily or weekly diary in which you record those things that have interested, surprised and/or frustrated you. Using the STAR Analysis tool will help you make sense of some of your experiences and contribute to your ability to provide evidence of relevant workplace skills that you have developed.</p><p>• It is important to act with a high level of professionalism and integrity throughout your placement. Remember that when you are on placement, you are also representing your fellow UWA students, the academic program you are studying and the wider University. Hence, completing time sheets, interim and post completion online surveys and, where required, interim achievement and planning documents contributes to a professional approach.</p><p>• Placements provide you with an opportunity to develop a relationship with a potential employer. However, please note that there are no guarantees that you would be offered employment simply through undertaking your placement.</p><p>Undertaking a practicum placement can be a stressful experience. Whilst a moderate amount of stress is a normal feature of working life, if you need extra support, the University offers a wide range of health and well being support services that can restore and balance your life. Information on these comprehensive health and well being support services can be accessed from: <a href='http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/experience/health' target='_blank' >http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/experience/health</a>.</p><p>Practicum Portfolio</p><p>The Practicum Portfolio comprises two parts: the in-placement evaluation tasks (40%) and post-placement tasks and final report (50%). These two parts will be completed in various ways including within practicum activities and the final Practicum and Reflection Report. You are required to complete your Practicum and Reflection Report in accord with the specific requirements for your internship and upload this report to LMS. </p><p>You are required to complete your Practicum and Reflection Report in accord with the specific requirements for your internship and to upload a final version of your Practicum and Reflection Report report to LMS. As the Practicum and Reflection Report is the only formal document that provides evidence of your achievement of the learning outcomes for WILG5001 and, where eligible, related post-graduate internship units, it is the critical task for you to complete in determining the academic outcome (i.e., pass or fail) of your enrolment in the unit.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite your best efforts, you may find that adverse changes in your health or well being have negatively impacted upon the completion of your practicum placement and/or report. In these circumstances, you may be eligible for ‘special consideration’ which may take the form of an extension for the completion of your practicum placement and/or report. UniAccess is able to provide advice and to assist you to make an application to your school office. However, you must read the conditions attaching to the granting of special consideration before lodging the Application for Special Consideration form. Links to UWA’s policy on the granting of special consideration are as follows: <a href='http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/course/exams/consideration' target='_blank' >http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/course/exams/consideration</a> and <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP11%2F23' target='_blank' >http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP11%2F23</a>.

Students can enrol in WILG5001 in First Semester, Second Semester or the non-standard teaching period over Summer (November to February) or Winter (June to July).</p><p>Satisfactory completion of the unit will result in a Pass grade (no numeric mark), and not contribute toward any major. The Academic Coordinator will provide support to students as they undertake the agreed work integrated learning activity and reflect on their overall experience. To pass the unit, students must not only demonstrate their ability to perform in the workplace but also to critically reflect on the experience and relate it to their academic studies.</p><p>More detailed information regarding assessments is available via the Assessments tab in the unit LMS.</p><p>The practicum portfolio for WILG5001 includes relevant documents relating to the practicum. Such documents include records relating to career-planning and pre-placement activities; quality assurance tasks and tools (e.g., online surveys, time sheets, and where used, achievement and planning milestone reports and STAR analyses) and the Practicum and Reflection Report.</p><p>A student who withdraws from WILG5001 after confirmation of placement with the host organisation will be determined to have failed the unit unless the Faculty is satisfied that there were exceptional circumstances to justify withdrawal.</p><p>Unit Schedule</p><p>As WILG5001 provides an individualised work integrated learning experience for each student, the typical teaching period unit schedule (e.g.,a semester) does not apply. Thus, interns must follow a work flow process that enables them to enrol in, undertake and report upon their internship in the teaching period that best matches the timing of their placement.</p><p>Once having their enrolment in WILG5001 and, where eligible, related post-graduate internship units approved, a student will engage in the planning and pre-placement activities related to their practicum, undertake a minimum of 100 hours of work experience per unit and complete their practicum portfolio which comprises all the tasks that have been completed and that support the drafting of the Practicum and Reflection Report. Whilst it is envisaged that all of these tasks will be undertaken prior to and during the enrolled teaching period, the timing and taking of the work experience may affect when all requirements are to be completed. Hence, while most units require all other assessable tasks to be completed prior to the commencement of the relevant end of teaching period examinations, the final date for the Practicum and Reflection Report is currently specified as being <strong>Friday 23 October 2021.</strong></p><p>How learning outcomes will be assessed:</p><p>Learning outcome 1: Practice effectively as an emerging professional through teamwork, collegial practice, conflict management and the adoption of appropriate professional conventions, as appropriate to the placement.</p><p>How achievement of learning outcomes will be assured: Work placement; practicum portfolio; and career planning and pre-placement activities.</p><p>Learning outcome 2: Apply communication and interpersonal skills to a working situation.</p><p>How achievement of learning outcomes will be assured: Work placement.</p><p>Learning outcome 3: Apply theoretical knowledge and frameworks in a practical setting.</p><p>How achievement of learning outcomes will be assured: Work placement; practicum portfolio.</p><p>Learning outcome 4: Reflect on and evaluate their performance in a professional context.</p><p>How achievement of learning outcomes will be assured: Practicum portfolio.</p><p>The UWA Careers Centre develops students' awareness, capacity and skills to manage their careers and make a successful transition from academic studies to employment. Students enrolled in WILG5001 and, where eligible, related post-graduate internship units, are required to complete at least two (2) career-related workshops either conducted by the Careers Centre or an approved external provider. Registration for Careers Centre workshops can be completed at the CareerHub: <a href='https://uwa.careerhub.com.au' target='_blank' >https://uwa.careerhub.com.au</a> </p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
