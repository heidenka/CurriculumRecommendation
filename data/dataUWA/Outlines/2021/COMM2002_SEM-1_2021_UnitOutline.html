                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Established and emerging technologies along with the convergence and decentralisation of media production and distribution has seen an explosion of pervasive forms of multimodal communication across many fields and sectors. This unit introduces students to core elements in multimodal literacy and practices, particularly in relation to digital story production, and examines how cultural knowledge and meaning is produced and negotiated in these increasingly collaborative texts. Through a combination of theory and practical activities, primarily using digital video equipment and software, this unit offers students an understanding of the communicative techniques involved in creating compelling digital narratives and the technical, creative and collaborative skills required to communicate effectively in rapidly evolving Media and Communications industries.</p></p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Lecture Capture System</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>In accordance with UWA’s policy on lecture capture all lectures* in enabled venues will be recorded and made available to stream and download by enrolled students via the Lecture Capture System (LCS) for the duration of the unit (including Supplementary and Deferred Examinations period).

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit is delivered in a blended f2f and online multimodal learning style in which students engage with a variety of communication forms - oral, digital, written, online - to encourage them to articulate understandings of the media, language, concepts and practices of their chosen field, and of themselves as students.</p><p>Most digital media production is collaborative. In order to model industry processes and due to the practical requirements of shooting and editing digital media, a large weighting of the assessment work in this unit involves working in a group. It is therefore essential that students work effectively as team members via face to face and online meetings.</p><p>Groups are strongly encouraged to exchange reliable contact information with each other as early as possible, and to maintain regular contact throughout the semester. It is each group’s responsibility to effectively organise itself. If serious problems arise students should contact their tutor immediately, but should make every effort to plan carefully to avoid difficulties wherever possible.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

A detailed Unit Schedule is available on LMS:</p><p>Lectures (2 hours - online only) will provide students with detailed information and examples to understand the theories and processes involved in digital storytelling, including its conceptual, creative, organisational, technical, and communicative elements. Lectures will also address all relevant information regarding the assessment requirements and the assessment criteria</p><p>Workshops (1 hour - f2f only): workshops will act as a practical forum where student groups will meet for consultations and liaise closely with their tutor who will inform, support and guide the progress of their work. Workshops are also an opportunity for students to discuss wider issues they have found interesting or difficult to understand. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the delivery mode of workshops may change so students are required to regularly check unit announcements and Unit Schedule updates.</p><p>Demonstrations (2 hours - f2f): demos will involve technical instruction relating to digital video production and editing software. Due to COVID-19, the delivery mode of demos may change so students are required to regularly check unit announcements and Unit Schedule updates.</p><p>Meetings(f2f &amp; online): students are expected to do further preparation, and regularly meet outside of scheduled classes with group members to work on their assessments.</p></p></pre></p>

All of these readings can be accessed via the LMS menu.</p><p><strong>Important Information</strong></p><p><strong>Teamwork and group assignments</strong></p><p>To model the collaborative way that digital media is produced in various creative media industries, a large proportion of the work and assessment in this unit involves working in teams. Teams are strongly advised to exchange reliable contact information with each other as early as possible, maintain continuous contact throughout the semester. Organising yourselves professionally and effectively is the team’s responsibility. If serious teamwork related problems arise, you should contact your tutor immediately, but students should make every effort to communicate with their teams and plan and execute their productions efficiently to avoid difficulties wherever possible.</p><p><strong>Copyright</strong></p><p>The production, distribution and use of media content are subject to Intellectual Property and Copyright laws.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
