One tutorial on 'how to present a seminar' is delivered at the beginning of semesters 1 and 2 to cater for the two intakes of honours students. Students attend all presentations in the seminar appraisal and presentation (SCB) seminar series. In the first two-thirds of their honours program, students attend interactive seminar appraisal sessions for four of these seminars, and present a critique to the group. Students then demonstrate their acquired knowledge and skills in a formal presentation of their research at the end of their honours program. The main academic objectives are for students to gain the ability to recognise quality presentation styles and content, and develop skills in critical thinking and analysis. They also learn how to construct an oral presentation that is visually attractive and scientifically robust, and deliver the information in a lucid and logical manner.</td>

One introductory lecture on 'how to present a seminar' is delivered at the beginning of semester 1. Students must attend all presentations in the allocated seminar critique sessions which span over semesters 1 and 2 and must achieve at least a 70% attendance for the Bayliss seminar series which span over semesters 1 and 2. Students then demonstrate their acquired knowledge and skills in a formal presentation of their research at the end of their honours program in semester 2. The main academic objectives are for students to gain the ability to recognise quality presentation styles and content, and develop skills in critical thinking and analysis. They also learn how to construct an oral presentation that is visually attractive and scientifically robust, and deliver the information in a lucid and logical manner.</p><p><br></p></p></pre></p>

This will start with a short lecture on how to present a seminar, followed by an overview of the unit and assessments and upcoming seminars will be highlighted in this lecture.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bayliss Seminars: The seminars are normally held on Thursday and/or Friday at 12 noon, in Bayliss G33. Attend as many of the Bayliss Seminar Series as possible. A sign-in sheet will be provided in the seminar room to record attendance. Students must achieve at least a 70% attendance to the Bayliss Seminars.</p><p>The seminar speakers are drawn from across the country and internationally as well as from within the School and University. However, it is not possible for us to have finalised all the travel arrangements for all of the visitors at this stage. The Seminar program will be developed over the course of the year, and as distinguished speakers announce their plans to visit Perth and UWA. We will give as much notice of the seminars as possible, through:</p><p>• the seminar mail list <a href='https://maillists.uwa.edu.au/mailman/listinfo/sem-scb' target='_blank' >https://maillists.uwa.edu.au/mailman/listinfo/sem-scb</a> (<a href='https://maillists.uwa.edu.au/mailman/listinfo/sem-scb' target='_blank' >https://maillists.uwa.edu.au/mailman/listinfo/sem-scb</a>)</p><p>• plasma screens in the Bayliss Foyer</p><p>• notices in the Bayliss elevators</p><p>• the website <a href='http://www.chembiochem.uwa.edu.au/research/seminars' target='_blank' >http://www.chembiochem.uwa.edu.au/research/seminars</a> (<a href='http://www.chembiochem.uwa.edu.au/research/seminars' target='_blank' >http://www.chembiochem.uwa.edu.au/research/seminars</a>)</p><p>Please attend a broad spectrum of talks – you will hopefully be pleasantly surprised at how much you can learn from talks which are oen quite unrelated to the specific focus of your research project.</p><p>The critique: Each member of the class will be assigned to a team, within groups. Each team will be assigned to one of the Bayliss Seminars, which they will assess and critique. YOU MUST ATTEND THE ASSESSED SEMINARS IN YOUR GROUP AND THE ASSOCIATED CRITIQUE SESSIONS.</p><p>Each team will give a 10 –15 minute group presentation discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the seminar to the class, and submit a written 1 page summary of the critique (please ensure you include the “assignment cover sheet” which is provided on LMS). The group will then have the opportunity to discuss the critique and the presentation aspects of the seminar with a view to gaining and sharing best practice.</p><p>To help guide you, a copy of the assessment sheet “Seminar appraisals guide sheet” that will be used for your end of year seminar is included in the Honours handbook, and on the LMS site under Unit Information. You may find it useful to structure your critique on these lines, but it is not essential to do so. Any format that gives a balanced, fair and honest appraisal of the seminar presentation is valid. You will be notified of critique team assignments on LMS once they have been allocated.</p><p>End of year Honours research seminar: Students will demonstrate their acquired knowledge and skills in a formal presentation of their honours research at the end of their honours program<br></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>

                        <li>serious injury</li>
                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The full policy and information on applying for special consideration is available at <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/course/exams/consideration">http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/course/exams/consideration</a></p>
