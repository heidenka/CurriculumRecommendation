It gives students a practical background in both Indonesian language and Indonesian culture. Students consolidate what they learned in secondary school Indonesian, especially the grammar, and expand their vocabulary. In addition they 'take a tour' through parts of Indonesia, so that when they go to Indonesia, they know how to behave, how to survive and how to explore Indonesian society, culture and environment. The unit aims to equip students with the listening and speaking skills to travel in Indonesia, to enable them to read simple information about places and life in Indonesia and to describe places and travel in Indonesia in prose and conversations.

The unit is for students who have completed Indonesian: Second Language at secondary school to the level of WACE Stage 2 (or equivalent) and is available only to students in their first year of Indonesian at UWA. It is run parallel to INDO1403 Indonesian 3 and aims to reinforce and solidify knowledge of grammar, syntax and vocabulary taught in Level 1, to significantly expand vocabulary and oral and written fluency, and to extend student capacity in all four language areas (speaking, listening, writing and reading) of contemporary Indonesian. It broadens Indonesian language and cultural knowledge. A larger, intangible objective is to nurture an interest in Indonesian culture and society.</td>

                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit enhances students' basic social proficiency in Indonesian at intermediate level, augmenting INDO2403 Indonesian 3 with the emphasis on more sophisticated spoken and written Indonesian. This unit is for students who have completed INDO1402 Indonesian 2. It gives students some very practical background in both Indonesian language and Indonesian culture. You will consolidate what you learned in Indonesian 1401/1402, especially the grammar, and expand your vocabulary. In addition you will be “taking a tour” through parts of Indonesia, so that when you go there for real, you will know how to behave, what to do to survive and how to explore aspects of Indonesian society and environment that make the place so incredibly rich and fascinating.   </p><p>Indonesian 3A is available only to second year students who have studied Indonesian for one year at university level.  It is run parallel to Indonesian 2403 and aims to reinforce and solidify knowledge of grammar, syntax and vocabulary taught in first-year, to significantly expand vocabulary and oral and written fluency, and to extend student capacity in all four language areas (speaking, listening, writing and reading) of contemporary Indonesian. It will broaden your Indonesian language and cultural knowledge to a level rivaling or exceeding that of past WACE Indonesian candidates who will be joining you, as first year students, studying Indonesian 1403.</p><p>The unit aims to equip you with the listening and speaking skills to travel in Indonesia, to enable you to read about places and cultures and life in Indonesia and to describe in prose and conversations places in Indonesia. You will be able to communicate your traveling needs when in Indonesia and be able to understand verbal answers at a simple level.  You will also be able to read and comprehend simple descriptions of places in Indonesia and to write simple prose in correct Indonesian on topics such as the above. </p><p>This unit also aims to familiarise students with some of the ways in which Indonesian culture and ways of living are different from those commonly found in Australia, and to acquaint you with the geography of Indonesia as well as some of the attractions of traveling in Indonesia. Thus, a larger, intangible objective is to nurture an interest in Indonesian culture and society.</p><p>Effective participation in the course requires that students devote a minimum of ten hours per week to learning activities. This will consist of two contact hours and eight hours of non-contact or home study. </p><p>OUTCOME BASED EDUCATION STATEMENTS</p><p>Students are able to hold simple conversations in Indonesian, describe their everyday experiences and needs, read texts with the help of a dictionary and write simple essays in Indonesian.</p><p>By the end of this semester it is expected that students will be able to communicate their needs in Indonesian, understand the culture and way of life in different places/islands of Indonesia, and to read and write simple descriptions about daily activities. Students will be able to read simple information about places to see in Indonesia (museums, religious sites, cities, national parks, etc.) and will be able to write prose descriptions of these places. </p><p>It is expected that students will be able to communicate their needs slowly but fluently in the above situations and to understand a native speaker’s answers, if these are given slowly and clearly.  Students should be able to write sentences that are grammatically and semantically correct. Students will be able to demonstrate that they can manipulate the passive and active voices in Indonesian, that they can correctly use  prepositions, transitive and intransitive verbs, affixation and the negative, and can appropriately deploy personal pronouns, request words and imperatives.</p></p></pre></p>

There are various activities on spontaneous conversations, speaking, reading, viewing and listening.</p><p><strong>Formal Preparation for Contact Session</strong></p><p>•	It is essential that you prepare for classes in order to derive maximum benefit from the activities. </p><p>•	You are required to prepare all the exercises and readings listed in your Unit Outline BEFORE the session. </p><p>•	This preparation is assessed. </p><p>•	Preparation should consist of reading and memorizing the conversations (Percakapan in the Unit Reader and materials on LMS), </p><p>•	Reading the notes and explanations in LMS and the Unit Reader, </p><p>•	studying vocabulary and attempting all the set exercises in LMS, </p><p>•	studying (revising) for tests, and </p><p>•	learning vocabulary and memorizing patterns in LMS and the Unit Reader.</p><p>•	listening to exercises in LMS.</p><p>•	Write down any questions to ask your lecturer in class.</p><p><strong>Test Study</strong></p><p>It is very important that you study for your tests from Week 1. You need to maintain sound study habits throughout the semester. Language learning requires ongoing, steady learning. Studying in bursts now and then places too much strain on the memory and is, therefore, far less efficient and effective than continuous study. Remember that your marks in continuous assessment will reflect the effort you make and that it represents a large component of your overall assessment for the semester. Don’t forget to revise for the test.</p><p><strong>Additional Study and Practice</strong></p><p>You will need to do additional practice and study because you need to master the language elements presented in the course. This means understanding the language in written and spoken form and producing the language in written and spoken form. </p><p>•	Practising with a classmate	}	these activities will help you develop automatic</p><p>•	Finding an Indonesian friend	}	responses &amp; spontaneity in conversations. </p><p>•	There is Indonesian news on TV (channel 32) at 5.30/6.20 am (but don’t worry if you can’t understand the Indonesian news on SBS!). </p><p>Stuck for ideas?</p><p>•	You should discuss with your classmates other study methods they find useful and vary your strategies so that you stay interested.</p></p></pre></p>

Class attendance is especially important when tests and exams are scheduled because you will not have a second chance without a very good reason.  Failing to attend at other times will result in poor marks for class participation so it is recommended that students attend all classes.  Marks of 0-100% will be awarded for your general participation in all activities, not just for the specific assessment items.</div><p>There are 3 class tests in this unit. A student will not be permitted to take a test at another time unless he/she was ill on the day of the test and presents a medical certificate. ALL requests for alternative arrangements or late assessment must be submitted to the Faculty Student Office who will then instruct the unit coordinator whether that appeal has been successful. The mark awarded is 0-100%.<br></p><p>Students who are late in handing in their homework will incur a penalty of 5% of the assignment mark per day unless a medical certificate is submitted. The mark awarded is 0-100%.</p><p>Each student will make an oral presentation in Weeks 8 and 9. The topic is about a particular place in Indonesia that is of special interest of you, e.g. a city, a national park, an island or a single building such as a palace, museum, temple, church or mosque. Find some elements of culture, customs, or ways of life of the people in that area. The presentation should last in 10-15 minutes. Search the internet, but DO NOT PLAGIARISE! (See the Plagiarism notice). </p><p>This task requires thought and planning, so that it is clearly presented, has a point the audience can understand and indicates that you know what you are talking about. You should incorporate interaction with the audience in order that you ascertain their understanding and keep them interested! One way to do this is to give them a simple task before you begin the presentation that should be able to accomplish by listening to (and watching) your presentation.</p><p>You will be assessed on the content of the presentation (20%); the fluency (20%); the correctness and sophistication of the language used, e.g. grammar, vocabulary range, syntax (50%); and interaction with and interest to audience (10%). The mark awarded is 0-100%.</p><p>Each student will write a short piece of essay in Indonesian about 500 words long and double spaced, font size 12, based on your oral presentation. This written assignment is due on Week 10. You can write about the place, why it is special and its historical or cultural significance if any. Include pictures, maps or photos. Reference meticulously! Both English and Indonesian references are acceptable. [See the Library website <a href='http://www.library.uwa.edu.au/information-resources/guides' target='_blank' >http://www.library.uwa.edu.au/information-resources/guides</a> for how to reference].</p><p>You will be assessed on the content of the written work (30%); structure / cohesion of the written work (10%); linguistic correctness e.g. grammar, syntax, language structure (20%); range and sophistication of the language used, including vocabulary choice, affixation (20%); presentation (10%); and referencing (10%). The mark awarded is 0-100%.</p><p>You will work in pairs, converse with each other (also ask questions and provide answers), and each one will be assessed on the content of the conversations (20%); the fluency (20%); the correctness and sophistication of the language used, e.g. grammar, vocabulary range, syntax (50%); and interaction with another student you converse with (10%). The mark awarded is 0-100%.</p><p>You will be assessed on your writing skills, either in reading comprehension and answering questions, writing short conversations, paragraphs, essays, translations, or completing sentences, etc. You need to read the instructions for each part of the examination carefully. The mark awarded is 0-100%.</p><p>1.	In accordance with Faculty regulations, any student who does not make satisfactory progress in the course may be excluded from taking the final examination.</p><p>2.	A penalty of 5 per cent of the possible mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays), after which the assigned work is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due. For example, a student, who has submitted a piece of work for an assessment item late by three days and was scored a mark of 45 out of a possible mark of 50, receives after penalty a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day as a penalty for each student from the mark obtained). Where there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied holistically to the assessment item after all tasks have been completed. If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course.</p><p>3.     Students may not submit a piece of work twice, either in the Unit or from other Units.

The Harvard referencing style is also known as the "author date" system because you must cite both the author and publication date. There is no definitive version of Harvard available.)The library will provide online guides, EndNote styles and support for the prescribed coursework (undergraduate and postgraduate) referencing styles.</p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>

UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
