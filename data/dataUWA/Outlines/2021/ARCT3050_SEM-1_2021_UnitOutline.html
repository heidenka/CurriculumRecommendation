                                    <td>This unit investigates the rapidly changing conceptions of “Matter” or material innovation in design, through digital fabrication and 1:1 prototyping. Within this context, students will engage and apply new digital or robotic fabrication methods and technologies, prototyping methods, and experimental material development, culminating in 1:1 prototypes or assemblages exhibiting bespoke properties. Students will research the relation between material properties and specific prototyping methods (CNC, 3D printing, robotic fabrication, etc.) and apply this research towards ‘learning by making' to design, develop and prototype functional or “responsive” material assemblies. Project development and outcomes will explore and apply contemporary topics relating to material craft, digital fabrication, and emerging technologies such as robotic fabrication and smart and responsive materials.

The overall academic objective of the unit is to develop a critical rethinking of “Material,” towards a new approach to design and making, combining both analog and digital craft. Material innovation and prototyping topics and projects provide a critical and practical foundation for students to engage twenty-first century design practices, whereby the designer is involved in the development of new tools, processes, materials and prototypes.</td>

It is the responsibility of the student to plan ahead and obtain materials with sufficient time to have them available as needed during the project development phase. &nbsp;Specific material suggestions will be discussed during the first two weeks of class.</p><p>Note: Arduino, Sensors, etc. while not required, may be needed to accomplish specific tasks for the prototyping process or for tool control for Robotic Crafting.&nbsp;</p><p>Students interested in using these components are highly encourage to take the Makerspace induction, to gain access to the bench tools for rapid prototyping with Arduinos, etc. Link: <a href='https://wiki.uwamakers.com/' target='_blank' >https://wiki.uwamakers.com/</a></p><p><strong>Incidental Fees</strong></p><p>Incidental student fees and charges are costs incurred by students as part of their studies at UWA that are in addition to their tuition fees (further information is available here or contact your Faculty Office).</p><p>Participation in this unit will incur the following incidental fee(s): </p><p>(1) Materials + Hardware required for project development and prototyping (estimated cost - $100-$350 per student).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Additional information:</strong></p><p><strong>Moderation of Marks</strong></p><p>Students should be aware that marks can be adjusted in the period of time between a mark being given for an assessment item and the final mark in the official release of results by Student Administration. Students are referred to Part 1, Section 11.4 of the University Policy on: Assessment under Adjustment of Marks. <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&amp;id=UP15%2F5' target='_blank' >http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&amp;id=UP15%2F5</a></p><p>Criterion based assessment is designed to provide a measure of students' performance that is directly relevant to the learning outcomes. This approach to assessment provides an indication of the specific knowledge and skills each student can demonstrate through an assessment task.  The use of moderation (as currently defined in the assessment policy below) can and should be used where appropriate. </p><p>Moderation is defined in the University Policy on Assessment (the Policy) as “a process to ensure consistent, fair and reliable marking against academic standards” (definitions section). It is “employed to ensure appropriate and consistent marking standards within units, and that assessment outcomes are fair and reliable”.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>LMS File Size for Digital Submission </strong></p><p>Unless otherwise stated in this unit outline, please note that the maximum file size for digital upload to the Learning Management System (LMS) is 20MB. Files that are incorrect in format or are substantially over this file size limit may not be marked.  Please allow adequate time to upload to LMS, upload time is not grounds for special consideration.</p><p><strong>Authenticity of work</strong></p><p>We need to be able to establish the authenticity and authorship of your work, thus the minimum requirement for attendance is defined as no less than half the number of tutorials or studio sessions which are contributing, in process and development, to a submission.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Submission of Late Work </strong></p><p>Unless otherwise stated, all assessment tasks are due no later than 4pm on the date indicated in the unit's Assessment Items, with the exception of in-class assessment items such as tutorial presentations. Any assessment task which is submitted after the time indicated in the assessment items statement without a formal approved extension will be considered LATE and appropriate penalties will be applied. Information on penalties can be obtained in the Policy on Assessment at <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&amp;id=UP15%2F5' target='_blank' >http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&amp;id=UP15%2F5</a></p><p>Excluding digital assessments, all late assessments are to be submitted to the School of Design’s front office.</p><p><strong>Extensions </strong></p><p>The Faculty approves extensions only in exceptional circumstances in order to ensure that all students are treated fairly and that submission date schedules, which are designed to produce ordered work patterns for students, are not disrupted. Extensions may be authorised only by the allocated Faculty Course Advising Office or a delegated representative. In all cases, requests for extensions require the submission of Special Consideration form no later than three University working days after the due date.</p><p>Students are encouraged in the strongest possible terms to familiarise themselves with the Policy on Special Consideration available at <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&amp;id=UP11%2F23' target='_blank' >http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&amp;id=UP11%2F23</a></p><p><strong>Feedback </strong></p><p>Marked assessments submitted on time will be made available for collection by students at least one week before the next assessment in the unit is due (if it is related to the previous assessment), or no more than 15 University working days after submission, whichever is sooner.</p><p><strong>Building clean-up and folio collection (for units with folio submissions)</strong></p><p>Studios are expected to be left clean and tidy. Drawing boards are to be cleaned. Students must remove all personal property immediately after the submission of their folio. If the content of a folio is used for exhibition then the student must write their name on the back of the work so that when the exhibition is demounted collection is simplified. If staff or the Faculty wish to reserve work for reproduction and/or accreditation purposes then this should be negotiated with individual students.</p><p><strong>Charter of student rights and responsibilities </strong></p><p>The Charter of Student Rights and Responsibilities upholds the fundamental rights of students who undertake their education at the University of Western Australia.
