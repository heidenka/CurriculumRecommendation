                                    <td>Integrated pest management (IPM) is a decision system used to limit the damage caused by pests (weeds, diseases and insects). Underpinning all successful IPM decisions, development and implementation, is having a sound understanding of ecological aspects of the target pest. Without such knowledge, few IPM strategies are ever successful. This unit explores the ecological basis and strategic approach to develop and deploy IPM for long term (5-10 years or more) and over large geographic scale (within farms or area-wide), highlighting examples of successful and failed pest control approaches, and how their success or failure relate to ecological aspects of pests. This unit also highlights the underlying economic implications as well as short- and long-term consequences of pest management decisions. The unit also covers different ecological approaches to IPM to decrease the risk and magnitude of pest outbreaks over time, and details pest epidemiology and the critical factors driving pest challenges across arable cropping, animal (feed-base), and horticultural industries. The main ecological strategies cover landscapes, lifecycle analyses, natural enemies of pests and their requirements, cultural controls and agronomy, host plant and animal resistance to pests, GMOs, and other more specific methods. It will also explore the role of environmental and agronomic factors, including climate change, crop rotations, etc. in altering the ecological basis and successful application of IPM. This unit aims to provide a clear understanding of the ecological knowledge required to understand, predict and secure successful IPM outcomes, and will demonstrate the consequences of not having this foundational ecological understanding. In particular, this unit will highlight the complexity and challenges affecting IPM outcomes due to interacting multiple environmental and agronomic factors. The unit is critical to students with interests in applied crop protection and also highly relevant to students with broader interests in crop, animal (i.e., feed-base) or horticultural production systems in particular, but also food security in general.</td>

                    <p>AGRI5507 - AGRI5507_SEM-2_2021 - SEM-2-2021 - 2021 - Face to face / Blended learning</p>
                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p>Integrated pest management (IPM) is a decision system used to limit the damage caused by pests (weeds, diseases and insects). Underpinning all successful IPM decisions, development and implementation, is having a sound understanding of ecological aspects of the target pest. Without such knowledge, few IPM strategies are ever successful. This unit explores the ecological basis and strategic approach to develop and deploy IPM for long term (5-10 years or more) and over large geographic scale (within farms or area-wide), highlighting examples of successful and failed pest control approaches, and how their success or failure relate to ecological aspects of pests. This unit also highlights the underlying economic implications as well as short- and long-term consequences of pest management decisions. The unit also covers different ecological approaches to IPM to decrease the risk and magnitude of pest outbreaks over time, and details pest epidemiology and the critical factors driving pest challenges across arable cropping, animal (feed-base), and horticultural industries. The main ecological strategies cover landscapes, lifecycle analyses, natural enemies of pests and their requirements, cultural controls and agronomy, host plant and animal resistance to pests, GMOs, and other more specific methods. It will also explore the role of environmental and agronomic factors, including climate change, crop rotations, etc. in altering the ecological basis and successful application of IPM. This unit aims to provide a clear understanding of the ecological knowledge required to understand, predict and secure successful IPM outcomes, and will demonstrate the consequences of not having this foundational ecological understanding. In particular, this unit will highlight the complexity and challenges affecting IPM outcomes due to interacting multiple environmental and agronomic factors. The unit is critical to students with interests in applied crop protection and also highly relevant to students with broader interests in crop, animal (i.e., feed- base) or horticultural production systems in particular, but also food security in general.</p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>

This strategy is designed such that you will be able to (1) understand the diverse ecological bases for developing and deploying successful pest control methods along with their varying advantages and disadvantages in different production systems; (2) explain the role and influence of changes in environmental factors and of differing farming practices, and particularly their interactions, on pest ecology and subsequent success or failure of IPM applications; (3) understand the major ecological bases and understanding needed for predicting pest outbreaks and epidemics; and (4) identify, compare and evaluate the ecological bases for developing and deploying effective and long-term pest management tactics.</p><p>In summary, the learning and teaching strategy is designed to make you, by the end of this unit, scientists who understand the importance, nature and role of sound understanding of ecological aspects of the target pest in underpinning all successful IPM decisions. </p></p></pre></p>

There will be a mixture of learning formats including one or more guest lectures, a plan for and a subsequent major written assignment and a conference-style oral presentation on that assignment, and an online quiz. Interaction of students with teaching staff and peers is encouraged to get the most out of this unit. In particular, attendance at the weekly face-2-face workshops is highly recommended for those able to attend onsite at UWA (workshop sessions will be available online for those outside of Perth, Australia).<br></p><p>There will be approximately a total of 45 Lecture equivalents where the majority of lectures are given online but approx 15 of these will be critically important&nbsp; seminal lectures + discussions will occur Face2Face Workshops (but also recorded for those unable to come Face2Face). Again, you are strongly encouraged to attend these workshops as these will also provide opportunities for questions and general discussion opportunities.<br></p></p></pre></p>

For this you must ONLY USE PowerPoint365 itself. You need to use the desktop version of PowerPoint365, which you can download free from this site by copying and pasting into your browser <a href='https://www.it.uwa.edu.au/service-catalogue/software/office-365#how-do-i-get-it-' target='_blank' >https://www.it.uwa.edu.au/service-catalogue/software/office-365#how-do-i-get-it-</a> then click on OFFICE PORTAL link to login in to the Office suite that comes with your student account. All desktop versions of the Office suite are downloadable for both Mac and Windows platforms. There is a screen shot demonstration in PowerPoint and make sure you see the “GUIDE to RECORDING a narrated Orals Using PowerPoint” that is uploaded to the LMS webpages for WEEKS 35, 37 and 38 (i.e., weeks 6, 7, 8). The critical thing to remember is to make sure that we can see you presenting in your video presentation, and the small window view of you presenting in the bottom right hand side of the frame is fine for this.</p><p>You need to upload and submit your oral presentation .pptx file on LMS, into Turnitin. WARNING, while Turnitin does generally does not accept PowerPoints with animations or with embedded or linked YouTube videos, and sometimes the metadata behind the PowerPoint file can make submission through ‘Turnitin’ a little challenging.</p><p>In relation to the LABORATORY SESSION ON 26TH AUGUST, FOR STUDENTS BASED OUTSIDE OF PERTH AND NOT ABLE TO ACCESS THE UWA CAMPUS: For those students based outside of Perth and unable to attend this lab session please note that this session will be designed in a way so as not to penalise you in any way and summary notes will be uploaded after the lab session.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
                    <p>If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend</li>
                        <li>serious injury</li>
                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
                        <li>serious disruption to domestic arrangements</li>
                    </ul>
