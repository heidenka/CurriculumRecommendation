PODI4202 begins by introducing you to general aspects of podiatric medicine such as hand hygiene, sterile technique, non-touch technique, wound cleaning and dressing. Other essential topics which are covered under general podiatry is cultural orientation, professionalism, privacy and clinical records, and case presentations. All of which are to prepare you for your external observational placements. As you will be representing the Discipline and the University on these placements, it is essential that you understand the importance of professional conduct. The supervisors on these placements may be your potential employer when you graduate, this is especially important as you’ll soon learn the podiatric medical community in Western Australia is small.</p><p>Week 6 students will begin learning how to make an orthotic. This will occur in the orthotic laboratory at Park Avenue. All students must undergo a competency assessment for the equipment in the laboratory, prior to the first laboratory. Students are expected to familiarise themselves with the relevant OHS for the orthotic laboratory, in addition to reviewing the standard operating procedures for the orthotic laboratory equipment under the OHS folder on the Unit contents section.</p><p>You will also learn musculoskeletal podiatry which covers orthopaedic examinations of the Hip, Knee, Ankle and Foot. In additional specialised tests for the foot and ankle, and examination of reflexes, gait and coordination.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

Attendance will be taken at these compulsory sessions. Students must ensure they have signed in for the teaching sessions where roll is kept. It is not the responsibility of the tutor or demonstrator. You will be considered to be absent if you have not signed in for the session. Students can only miss 1 compulsory session during the semester without a medical certificate. In the case of illness, a medical certificate (not provided by a family member) must be supplied to the unit coordinator within one week of return to classes. Any missed tasks will need to be completed by this time. Note that the onus is on the student to make contact regarding absences. If a student misses more than this, he/she will be expected to contact the unit coordinator with an explanation. A failure to provide a valid explanation, or further missed classes will result in action according to the FHMS Professional Behaviour Assessment.</p><p>Lateness: Students who are consistently late to teaching sessions and clinics (more than 10 minutes) will be marked as late and an explanation will be sought from the student. Your fellow students and teachers appreciate punctuality which is part of professional behaviour and courtesy. Multiple late arrivals will be managed according to the FHMS Professional Behaviour Assessment. Late arrival at lectures and clinical laboratories is also discourteous and unprofessional. If you are unavoidably late, it is important that you do not enter a lecture theatre by the front entrance.</p><p>It is critical that where a student is assigned to attend a particular session at a particular time, only that session may be attended. Students are not to attend non-assigned sessions for their convenience. Students doing so will be subject to the FHMS Professional Behaviour Assessment process. Session times are allocated based on a random group allocation for laboratory/tutorial sessions.</p><p>If you’re unable to attend the clinical or orthotic laboratories or if sick, please email Amelia Na in a timely manner.</p><p>If you’re unable to attend your clinical placement, please email Hannah Chun, Amelia Na and your placement lead in a timely manner.</p><p>Please do not leave that responsibility to a class mate. We expect professional behaviour from students at all times.</p></p></pre></p>
