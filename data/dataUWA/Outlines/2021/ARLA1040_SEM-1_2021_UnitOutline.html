It develops visual literacy and is a broad introduction to tools, techniques and media involved in the creation and communication of design ideas. Core competencies for visualising project work are developed through weekly drawing exercises in software intensive labs, while lectures provide a broader critical framework around contemporary and historical drawing practices.</p></p></pre></p>

* Please note that in some limited circumstances lectures may not be recorded due to:  ethical and/or security related issues; the use of commercially sensitive material; the use of third-party copyright teaching material; or culturally sensitive content. Students will be advised, in advance, when this applies.</p></pre></p>
                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>LCS will be used to record content in this unit. It is assumed that all students will attend and/or watch all technical lectures and lectures, where major assignments will be introduced. This information (and more) will not be repeated and students should ensure that they attend all lectures to receive all information. Individual queries relating to information that has been previously delivered in lectures may not be answered.</p><p>Learning in this unit is designed to be integrated between lectures; where the emphasis is on concepts, examples, and the relationship of visualisation to design, technical lectures; where the emphasis is on attainment of specific digital drawing skills by demonstration, and workshops, where students have the opportunity to develop and demonstrate their own skills in short in-class assignments.</p><p>Major assignments will be introduced in lectures, and worked on in students' own time, using the skills and knowledge gained in lectures, technical lectures and workshops. Students will also be assessed by work produced in workshops, so it is imperative that you attend promptly and submit the required material for each workshop assessment in order to receive marks.</p><p>To get the most out of the unit, it is critical to attend all lectures, watch and practise skills introduced in all technical lectures, and attend all workshops. Tutors in workshops will be a vaulable resource of help and motivation, but will expect that students have attended the face to face lecture and watched the technical lecture prior to each week's workshop, and will be able to offer a limited scope of assistance if you have not done so.</p></p></pre></p>

Self-plagiarism is considered a serious breach of academic integrity and is defined by the university as the recycling, copying, or disguising of previous work for assessment in a unit.</p><p><u><strong>Assessment Information</strong></u></p><p><strong>Major Assignments</strong> should be uploaded to LMS prior to the deadline. Assignments need to be under the file size limit of 20Mb and the correct PDF file type. Files that are not PDF file types or over 20Mb in size will be ineligible for marks. Please allow adequate time to upload to LMS - upload time is not grounds for special consideration.</p><p><strong>In class continuous assessments</strong> should be uploaded to LMS within your individual allocated workshop time in order to receive marks. Assignments need to be under the file size limit of 20Mb and the correct PDF file type.</p><p><strong>LMS File Size for Digital Submission</strong></p><p>Unless otherwise stated in this unit outline, please note that the maximum file size for digital upload to the Learning Management System (LMS) is 20MB. Files that are incorrect in format or are substantially over this file size limit may not be marked. Please allow adequate time to upload to LMS, upload time is not grounds for special consideration.</p><p><strong><u>Moderation of marks</u></strong></p><p>Students should be aware that marks can be adjusted in the period of time between a mark being given for an assessment item and the final mark in the official release of results by Student Administration. Students are referred to Part 1, Section 11.4 of the University Policy on: Assessment under Adjustment of Marks.</p><p>Criterion based assessment is designed to provide a measure of students' performance that is directly relevant to the learning outcomes. This approach to assessment provides an indication of the specific knowledge and skills each student can demonstrate through an assessment task. The use of moderation (as currently defined in the assessment policy below) can and should be used where appropriate.</p><p>Moderation is defined in the University Policy on Assessment (the Policy) as “a process to ensure consistent, fair and reliable marking against academic standards” (definitions section). It is “employed to ensure appropriate and consistent marking standards within units, and that assessment outcomes are fair and reliable”.</p><p><strong><u>Authenticity of work</u></strong></p><p>We need to be able to establish the authenticity and authorship of your work, thus the minimum requirement for attendance is defined as no less than half the number of tutorials or studio sessions which are contributing, in process and development, to a submission.</p><p><strong><u>Submission of Late Work</u></strong></p><p>Unless otherwise stated, all assessment tasks are due no later than 4pm on the date indicated in the unit's Assessment Items, with the exception of in-class assessment items such as tutorial presentations. Any assessment task which is submitted after the time indicated in the assessment items statement without a formal approved extension will be considered LATE and appropriate penalties will be applied. Information on penalties can be obtained in the Policy on Assessment at <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&amp;id=UP15%2F5' target='_blank' >http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&amp;id=UP15%2F5</a></p><p><strong><u>Extensions</u></strong></p><p>The Faculty approves extensions only in exceptional circumstances in order to ensure that all students are treated fairly and that submission date schedules, which are designed to produce ordered work patterns for students, are not disrupted. Extensions may be authorised only by the allocated Faculty Course Advising Office or a delegated representative. In all cases, requests for extensions require the submission of Special Consideration form no later than three University working days after the due date.</p><p>Students are encouraged in the strongest possible terms to familiarise themselves with the Policy on Special Consideration available at <a href='http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&amp;id=UP11%2F23' target='_blank' >http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?method=document&amp;id=UP11%2F23</a></p><p><strong><u>Feedback</u></strong></p><p>Marked assessments submitted on time will be made available for collection by students at least one week before the next assessment in the unit is due (if it is related to the previous assessment), or no more than 15 University working days after submission, whichever is sooner.</p><p><strong><u>Charter of student rights and responsibilities</u></strong></p><p>The Charter of Student Rights and Responsibilities upholds the fundamental rights of students who undertake their education at the University of Western Australia.

                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
