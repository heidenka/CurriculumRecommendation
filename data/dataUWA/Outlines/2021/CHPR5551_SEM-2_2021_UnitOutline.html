They can not be taken separately under any circumstances. They should be taken as late as sensibly possible within the course giving you as much prior knowledge as possible. The project is a capstone experience in which students integrate and apply knowledge and skills acquired in earlier units to a substantial real-world design challenge relevant to their discipline. Students work in teams, typically with four to six members, and are supervised by an academic and/or industry mentor. Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project are to lead students through a systematic engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare them for professional practice as engineers. The focus of the unit is on teamwork skills and the design process.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>The Chemical Engineering Design Project consists of units CHPR5551 and CHPR5552 and both units are taken in a single semester (as a double unit) as late as possible in your degree. The project is a capstone experience in which students integrate and apply knowledge and skills acquired in earlier units to a substantial real-world design challenge relevant to their discipline. Students work in teams, typically with four to six members, and are supervised by an academic and/or industry mentor. Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project are to lead students through a systematic engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare them for professional practice as engineers. The focus of the unit is on teamwork skills and the design process. </p><p>This is the capstone unit for the Chemical Engineering Degree. It will allow you to bring together much of your previously learnt engineering knowledge on a real, practical problem. It contributes 12 points of the whole year assessment.</p><p>The Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) and the Institution of Engineers Australia (IEAust) also place a high priority on this subject as part of your entry into the profession.</p><p>The project is also quite different to the majority of subjects that you have done over the past four years. It is a team effort and open ended. Many problems you have faced in your course so far are artificially contrived with the solution known to the instructor. In the industrial world you will normally work as a team on open-ended projects where communication amongst members is vital. There is no ''right'' solution! - just the "best" solution in the time available.</p><p>One of the goals of this subject is to introduce you to such a work process. The staff will endeavour to give advice and support to you as you proceed in the project. The group will be managed by its members. There needs to be a leader who co-ordinates activities. It is the responsibility of the group members to ensure that the project progresses at an appropriate rate. Good communication within the group is essential and this will be reflected in your final mark. It will show your efforts at teamwork and your ability to communicate your design to academic staff, tutors and engineering consultants.</p></p></pre></p>

For submission 1, the assessment is formative, for sub 4 it is punitive (marks lost). Specifics will be discussed in the lectures however the basics are as follows.</p><p>All group meetings will result in production of meeting minutes including a section on group member assessment. Issues with poor performing group members (either lack of engagement or poor work quality) in sub 1 will be noted in the minutes and resolution mechanisms and results must also be included in the minutes. If member’s issues are not corrected, a meeting with the member(s) and lecturers will be held to discuss the issue and resolution. Written feedback will also be supplied to the student(s).</p><p>If the problematic behavior continues in submission 4 (through the same reporting procedure) punitive action involving marks loss will be enacted as the student(s) had prior warning (sub 1 feedback). </p><p>Failed Component</p><p>Submissions 2 and 3 are designated as failed component. That means that if you fail (achieve mark below 50) for either submissions 2 or 3, then you by default fail the entire CHPR5551 and CHPR5552 and therefore will have to repeat the unit(s) in a subsequent year. </p><p>The process for submissions 2 and 3 are as follows:</p><p>a)	You submit your submission as normal and it is marked and you receive written feedback.</p><p>b)	If the mark is less than 50, you have two weeks after receiving written feedback to resubmit the improved assessment.</p><p>c)	If the resubmitted submission is of required quality (would receive a mark greater than or equal to 50) then the student passes the submission but retains the original failing mark for that assessment.</p><p>d)	If the resubmitted submission is adjudged to still be of failing quality, the assessment is deemed failed and hence CHPR5551/2 is deemed a fail (due to sub 2 and 3 being failed component) and the student would have to repeat the whole unit(s) in a subsequent year.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
                    <h4>Special Considerations</h4>
                    <p>If your study has been adversely affected by illness or other significant circumstances outside of your control, you can apply for special consideration. Significant circumstances may include but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>serious illness or death of a member of the student's immediate family or household or of a close friend</li>
                        <li>serious injury</li>
                        <li>being a victim of a crime</li>
                        <li>breakdown of relationship</li>
                        <li>sudden loss of income or employment</li>
