                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>Around 2500 years ago the historical Buddha set out on a quest to discover and eliminate suffering – initially understood as mental suffering (e.g., fear, anxiety, unhappiness). The story goes that he discovered the root cause of suffering to be a pervasive attachment to things being one way rather than another! The way out of suffering would be to uproot this attachment via a massive cognitive shift. The Buddha was famously said to have attained this freedom from suffering: an exalted mode of being known as nibbāna. What are known as ‘The Four Noble Truths’ diagnose the cause and cure for suffering en route to nibbāna. All other Buddhist teachings, such as the law of kamma, no-self, and the nature of nibbānic consciousness open out from this core structure, which this unit examines in the first half of semester. </p><p>But is Buddhism the only path that purports to end suffering? No: there are other Eastern and mystical traditions that travel in the same direction. We focus, in the second part of the unit, on Advaita Vedanta, a form of Hinduism that calls this attainment mokṣa. Whether mokṣa and nibbāna could come to the same thing is something we’ll investigate. The final section of the unit brings everything together by asking: ‘Now we have a better idea of what is meant by these Eastern claims, are they philosophically plausible?’ The psychological possibility of nibbāna or mokṣa carries fascinating metaphysical implications as to how reality would have to be structured if they really were attainable. Perhaps everything would have to be grounded in a pure universal consciousness rather than a mind-independent material world! We look into what this could mean and what it would take to argue for it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

As such, you are expected to attend all the lectures. For those genuinely unable to attend for reasons of unavoidable clash, sickness or work commitments, recordings will be made available.</p><p>To encourage attendance, <u>5% of the final mark will be on lecture participation</u>, which involves attending lectures, and asking questions or attentively listening. <u>A roll will be taken as evidence of in-class attendance.</u> Hand-written notes are encouraged and those with lap-tops must sit at the back so that others are not distracted by your screen. If, for reasons of clashing lectures or paid work commitments, you have to rely on listening to recorded lectures (not recommended for this unit) you must inform me with relevant documentation within the first two weeks of semester. I will accordingly weight your lecture participation mark on a weekly written summary of the missed lectures. These can be two short written paragraphs, each briefly summarising the theme of two previous recorded lectures (Thursday previous week before and the Tuesday just gone) or simply the notes that you took while listening to it – handwriting is fine. The notes must include the date of each lecture and show specific evidence of material alluded to in the lecture that is more than a re-hash of what’s in the unit outline. The summary is to be handed in at your tutorial (no extensions are permitted). </p><p><u>5% of your mark will also be on tutorial participation</u>, which involves attending tutorials and actively asking questions or listening. Unless in case of lockdown, no laptops please in tutorials – they create a physical and psychological barrier between you and the rest of the group.  For tutorials, you are expected to have done the weekly reading, as indicated in the Unit Structure at a glance, and I will be guiding discussion in a way that presupposes familiarity with the readings. To help you to actively navigate the salient points in each reading, I will be providing a weekly question sheet based on that week’s reading. Please attempt to answer these before the tutorial! Print these sheets out (including your answers) and take them to the tutorial along with the Unit Reader (available on demand from UniPrint) or a printed copy of the reading from LMS.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Lockdown contingency plan</u></strong>: In the event of a lockdown that prevents lecture attendance, recordings will be made available and the participation weighting will from that point onwards change to 10% tutorial participation. You will have still earnt your lecture participation marks up until that point. Should tutorials also move online, they will be in the same timeslots and you’ll earn your tutorial participation mark by showing up for the whole duration of the sessions and having your camera switched on so that you are in view. To prepare for this contingency, please take steps in advance to ensure you have the adequate technology including a webcam. Laptops are fine for these purposes. Webcams, which usually come with an inbuilt microphone, can be purchased from places such as Arrow Computers, Officeworks or online.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
