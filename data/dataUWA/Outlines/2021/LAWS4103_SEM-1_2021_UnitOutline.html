As most of the applicable law studied in Contract is common law case law this material is the primary focus of the unit. Students are also introduced to legislation that impacts on contract law in Australia. The unit begins with an examination of the rules relating to the formation of contracts and concepts of offer and acceptance, consideration, intention to create legal relations, privity and contract formalities. Students then study incorporation and construction of contractual terms and implication of terms. They continue mapping the life of a contract by investigating how contracts come to an end through agreement, performance, breach and repudiation, and frustration of contract. Although contract remedies are studied in a dedicated Remedies unit, students are introduced to restitutionary claims for unjust enrichment. They study the provisions in national consumer legislation (the Australian Consumer Law) that impact on the law of contract, in particular the law of misleading or deceptive conduct. Students analyse case law, extract legal principles from judicial decisions and clearly state them, and analyse and solve hypothetical legal problems relating to the topics covered.</td>

Hume expressed the liberal, individualistic temper of his time and place in treating respect for person, property, and contract as the self-evident foundations of law and justice. Through the greater part of our history, our constitutional law and politics have proceeded on these same premises. In private law particularly these premises have taken root and ramified in the countless particulars necessary to give them substance. The law of property defines the boundaries of our rightful possessions, while the law of torts seeks to make us whole against violations of those boundaries, as well as against violations of the natural boundaries of our physical person. Contract law ratifies and enforces our joint ventures beyond those boundaries. Thus the law of torts and the law of property recognize our rights as individuals in our persons, in our labor, and in some definite portion of the external world, while the law of contracts facilitates our disposing of these rights on terms that seem best to us. The regime of contract law, which respects the dispositions individuals make of their rights, carries to its natural conclusion the liberal premise that individuals have rights. And the will theory of contract, which sees contractual obligations as essentially self-imposed, is a fair implication of liberal individualism.” </p><p>Charles Fried (former Solicitor General of the United States of America and Professor, Harvard Law School) Contract as Promise (Harvard University Press 1981) 1-2.</p><p>In this course you will develop an ability to read, understand, analyse and apply the law of contract through the study of decided cases and contractual terms. As most of the applicable law studied in Contract Law is case law this material is the primary focus of the unit. Students are also introduced to legislation that impacts on contract law in Australia. The unit begins with an examination of the rules relating to the formation of contracts and concepts of offer and acceptance, consideration, intention to create legal relations, privity and contract formalities. Students then study incorporation and interpretation of contractual terms and implication of terms. They continue mapping the life of a contract by investigating how contracts come to an end through agreement, performance, breach and repudiation, and frustration of contract. Although contract remedies are studied in a dedicated Remedies unit, students are introduced to restitutionary claims for unjust enrichment and compensatory damages for breach of contract. Students will study the provisions in national consumer legislation (particularly the Australian Consumer Law) that impact on the law of contract, in particular the law of misleading or deceptive conduct and also certain judge made vitiating factors which enable contracts to be set aside (although many vitiating factors are taught in the Equity unit). Students analyse case law, extract legal principles from judicial decisions and clearly state them, and analyse and solve hypothetical legal problems and answer essay questions relating to the topics covered.</p><p>Unit learning outcomes</p><p>On the completion of this unit, you should be able to:</p><p>(1)	demonstrate an understanding of key aspects of Australian contract law including formation, terms and discharge of contracts; actions in debt and for breach, restitutionary claims and the impact of national consumer legislation on the common law of contract; </p><p>(2)	explain the relationship between the common law of contract and equity, contract law and restitution, and common law and legislation; </p><p>(3)	evaluate developments in or affecting the law of contract that promote ethical practice in a commercial setting; </p><p>(4)	analyse a hypothetical fact scenario and identify the relevant facts and legal issues raised and apply case law and statutory principles correctly to reach reasoned conclusions; and </p><p>(5)	provide an oral or written opinion on a hypothetical legal problem and/or a critical analysis of a case in a clear and concise manner and effectively communicate the opinion.</p><p> </p></p></pre></p>

Tutorial groups will remain the same all semester. Tutorials will be held weekly and will commence in the first week of the semester. Ten percent of your total mark in this unit will be allocated to your participation in tutorials (see Assessment below). It is therefore imperative that you attend your allocated tutorial group.</p><p>Students will not be credited for participation in a tutorial group to which they were not allocated.</p><p>For the tutorial questions please see the ‘Tutorial Guide’ uploaded to LMS.</p><p>Tutorials and External Commitments</p><p>The JD curriculum has been purposefully designed to scaffold sequential knowledge and skills progression, and may be completed in three years full-time or on a part-time basis.</p><p>Those who undertake external work, travel or sporting commitments are expected to plan these around their studies. Except in exceptional circumstances, these commitments are not accepted as grounds for a variation in the prescribed sequence of units, or as valid reasons for timetable changes, swapping tutorials, the waiving of prerequisites or variation from the prescribed course structure. *</p><p>In making a decision as to whether to complete the JD on a full or part-time basis, students must be aware that the estimated time commitment for a standard full-time enrolment is approximately 40 hours per week (over each 12 week semester), excluding examinations. Each unit, including intensive units in non-standard teaching periods, requires an overall time commitment of 150 hours.</p><p>* Students accepted into the UWA Elite Athletes Program, or who undertake exchange or other commitments which involve official representation of the Law School or the University, may seek approval from the Deputy Head of School (Students) for a variation in the prescribed course structure</p></p></pre></p>

You should also be ready to discuss the case law that is included within the required reading.  We only include a selection of cases for detailed discussion in each tutorial and this does not mean that other cases on the topic can be ignored. Be guided by your lectures and textbook reading as to the important cases in each area of law. If in doubt, speak to your tutor.</p><p>The additional ‘Further Discussion Questions’ are designed to guide you through some of the key principles that emerge from each topic and will help you clarify your thoughts on the topic.  Your tutor may want to discuss them in the tutorial with you to ensure your understanding of the issues that the tutorial raises.  Finally, anything that has not been discussed in class should not be dismissed as unimportant, but will potentially be examinable. </p><p>Please note that the tutor will not be able to cover EVERYTHING in the tutorial each week and will make decisions regarding the focus of the tutorial according to the particular needs of each class. </p><p>Attendance at tutorials is compulsory: you should be aware that absence from tutorials has serious consequences and may result in you being unable to sit the examination and a reduction in participation marks. </p><p>If you are unable to attend a tutorial you should contact your tutor in advance explaining your reasons. Your tutor may in exceptional circumstances allow you to attend another tutorial group to make up for the one that you have missed. Please do not under any circumstances attend another tutorial group without having obtained the express permission of your tutor and (where they differ) the tutor from the group that you want to attend. <br></p><p>There is a 10% tutorial participation mark which will be assessed by reference to your performance in your tutorials.</p><p>The objectives of the participation mark are to promote:</p><p>•	attendance, </p><p>•	engagement, </p><p>•	preparation, </p><p>•	reflection; and </p><p>•	responsible tutorial membership.</p><p>Engagement will most obviously be in speaking but a student might also be engaged whilst listening. This will be important to note for students who are by nature quieter. They may be engaged, though speak less often.</p><p>Preparation might be evident in notes the student has come with or in the quality of answers and comments in discussion.</p><p>Reflection on the issues (and preparation) might be evident in the student drawing on material outside the material directly related to the tutorial problem, perhaps from other topics in the course and in questions asked during (or even after) the tutorial seminar;</p><p>Responsible tutorial membership refers to the respect given to other student’s comments and refraining from attempting to dominate the discussion.</p><p> </p><p>Attendance is expected at all 12 tutorials over the course of the semester. We appreciate, however, that from time to time students may be unable to attend due to illness or some other reason. With this in mind, if a student misses 1 of the 12 tutorials this will not affect the tutorial participation mark. The mark will be based on the student’s performance over the remaining 11 tutorials.</p><p>Participation is about the quality and not necessarily the quantity of contributions (where ‘quality’ means considered and reflective contributions – you are allowed to make mistakes!). The aim of including this component is to encourage unselfconscious discussion amongst students, not an atmosphere of assessment.</p><p>All students are expected to prepare for, and to contribute to class discussions in, all tutorials. Attendance and participation is the key to effective learning. </p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
