Digital visualisation techniques for site analysis will use Photoshop and/or Illustrator) in combination with hand-drawing techniques. In addition, we will utilise both online data and mapping resources (Open Street Maps, USGS, etc) and related software (QGIS) to obtain necessary maps, data or information.</p><p><strong>PHSYICAL MODELS</strong></p><p>Students will obtain and utilise common craft materials (Toothpicks,"Satay" Sticks, paper or board) to support the learning of structural concepts, and to develop work for submission of projects and assignments.The unit consists of 1-hour online lecture + 2 hour tutorials (weekly).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PROJECT MATERIALS + TOOLS</strong></p><p>A detailed list of suggested or required project materials, tools and related items will be available on LMS before the first scheduled class. Please review this list carefully and obtain tools and materials as required for participation in tutorials and project development.</p><p><strong>ADDITIONAL POLICIES OR INFORMATION</strong></p><p>Self-Plagiarism</p><p>The submission of a single piece or body of work to multiple units for assessment constitutes self-plagiarism.  Self-plagiarism is considered a serious breach of academic integrity and is defined by the university as the recycling, copying, or disguising of previous work for assessment in a unit.</p><p>Assessment</p><p>In the case of folio units, to pass this unit, a student must: (a) achieve an overall mark of 50 per cent or higher for the unit; and (b) achieve the requisite requirements(s) or a mark of 50 per cent or greater, whichever is higher and specified in the unit outline, for the final folio component.</p><p>Moderation of marks</p><p>Students should be aware that marks can be adjusted in the period of time between a mark being given for an assessment item and the final mark in the official release of results by Student Administration. Students are referred to Part 1, Section 11.4 of the University Policy on: Assessment under Adjustment of Marks. <a href='https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Policy/Policy/Teaching-and-Research-Training/Learning-and-Teaching/Assessment/Assessment-Policy.rtf' target='_blank' >https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Policy/Policy/Teaching-and-Research-Training/Learning-and-Teaching/Assessment/Assessment-Policy.rtf</a></p><p>Criterion based assessment is designed to provide a measure of students' performance that is directly relevant to the learning outcomes. This approach to assessment provides an indication of the specific knowledge and skills each student can demonstrate through an assessment task.  The use of moderation (as currently defined in the assessment policy below) can and should be used where appropriate. </p><p>Moderation is defined in the University Policy on Assessment (the Policy) as “a process to ensure consistent, fair and reliable marking against academic standards” (definitions section). It is “employed to ensure appropriate and consistent marking standards within units, and that assessment outcomes are fair and reliable”. </p><p>LMS File Size for Digital Submission </p><p>Unless otherwise stated in this unit outline, please note that the maximum file size for digital upload to the Learning Management System (LMS) is 20MB. Files that are incorrect in format or are substantially over this file size limit may not be marked.  Please allow adequate time to upload to LMS, upload time is not grounds for special consideration.</p><p>Authenticity of work</p><p>We need to be able to establish the authenticity and authorship of your work, thus the minimum requirement for attendance is defined as no less than half the number of tutorials or studio sessions which are contributing, in process and development, to a submission.</p><p>Submission of Late Work </p><p>Unless otherwise stated, all assessment tasks are due no later than 4pm on the date indicated in the unit's Assessment Items, with the exception of in-class assessment items such as tutorial presentations. Any assessment task which is submitted after the time indicated in the assessment items statement without a formal approved extension will be considered LATE and appropriate penalties will be applied. Information on penalties can be obtained in the Policy on Assessment at <a href='https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Policy/Policy/Teaching-and-Research-Training/Learning-and-Teaching/Assessment/Assessment-Policy.rtf' target='_blank' >https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Policy/Policy/Teaching-and-Research-Training/Learning-and-Teaching/Assessment/Assessment-Policy.rtf</a></p><p>Excluding digital assessments, all late assessments are to be submitted to the School of Design’s front office.</p><p>Extensions </p><p>The School approves extensions only in exceptional circumstances in order to ensure that all students are treated fairly and that submission date schedules, which are designed to produce ordered work patterns for students, are not disrupted. Extensions may be authorised only by the allocated School Student Experience Course Advising Office or a delegated representative. In all cases, requests for extensions require the submission of Special Consideration form no later than three University working days after the due date.</p><p>Students are encouraged in the strongest possible terms to familiarise themselves with the Policy on Special Consideration available at  <a href='https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Policy/Policy/Student-Administration/Special-Consideration/Special-Consideration-Policy.rtf' target='_blank' >https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Policy/Policy/Student-Administration/Special-Consideration/Special-Consideration-Policy.rtf</a></p><p>Feedback </p><p>Marked assessments submitted on time will be made available for collection by students at least one week before the next assessment in the unit is due (if it is related to the previous assessment), or no more than 15 University working days after submission, whichever is sooner.</p><p>Building clean-up and folio collection (for units with folio submissions)</p><p>Studios are expected to be left clean and tidy. Drawing boards are to be cleaned. Students must remove all personal property immediately after the submission of their folio. If the content of a folio is used for exhibition then the student must write their name on the back of the work so that when the exhibition is demounted collection is simplified. If staff or the Faculty wish to reserve work for reproduction and/or accreditation purposes then this should be negotiated with individual students.</p><p>Charter of student rights and responsibilities </p><p>The Charter of Student Rights and Responsibilities upholds the fundamental rights of students who undertake their education at the University of Western Australia.   The University's charter of Student Rights and Responsibilities is available at   <a href='https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Policy/Policy/Student-Administration/Charter-of-Student-Right-and-Responsibilities/Charter-of-Student-Rights-and-Responsibilities.rtf' target='_blank' >https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy/-/media/Policy/Policy/Student-Administration/Charter-of-Student-Right-and-Responsibilities/Charter-of-Student-Rights-and-Responsibilities.rtf</a></p><p>UniAccess </p><p>UniAccess provides free services and support to UWA students who want to disclose a disability or a medical condition and request assistance <a href='http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/experience/health/uniaccess' target='_blank' >http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/experience/health/uniaccess</a></p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
