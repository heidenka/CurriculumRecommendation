                        <p><p>In the event of a shutdown due to COVID-19, you will be contacted by the unit coordinator via Announcements and email. Lecturers and teaching staff will facilitate and support online sessions when face-to-face sessions are not able to be conducted. These online sessions will be in the format of live lectures, pre-recorded lectures, eTutorials, live tutorials and workshops. Live online sessions will use Microsoft Teams. Links for scheduled sessions will be made available in the navigation panel in LMS and further instructions will be provided via announcements.</p><p><b>Online learning during the event of COVID-19 lockdown</b></p><p>To ensure Teams runs smoothly for your UWA sessions, download the Teams App to your desktop, laptop or mobile device, and sign-in using your Uni-ID (your student email and Pheme password). If you can’t download the Teams App, you can use the latest version of a browser such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge (Chromium), but interactivity tends to be limited in many other browsers. More information and tutorials for using Microsoft Teams are available at https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/learning-online where you can access quickstart guides.</p><p>Please ensure you have tested audio/video in advance. A headset and a microphone provides a clear way to capture your voice, and allows you to more clearly hear conversations. You will be encouraged to participate in online group work or in Q&amp;A.</p><p>Library staff can assist with troubleshooting Uni-ID issues which are so important to accessing the UWA systems via askUWA or email: askuwa-lib@uwa.edu.au.</p><p><b>Join from a location with a strong and stable internet connection</b></p><p>Reduce background noise by going to a private space. A wired connection is best. If you are using WiFi, then connect from your home.</p><p class=""><b>Appearance matters</b></p><p>If you are working in groups, participate in online drop in, ensure you have a clean background (what is visible behind you in your physical location) to ensure that it’s appropriate/not distracting and use the blur function if available. Check your lighting conditions. Lastly, be aware of your behaviour. When you are on video, people can see what you are doing at all times. It can be easy to forget you’re on camera, so just be mindful.</p><p><b>Online etiquette</b></p><p>Please remember that while learning online the University Charter of Students Rights and Responsibilities still applies.</p></p>

                                    <td>This unit continues to explore the professional role of the pharmacist introduced in PHCY5601 Introduction to Pharmacy Practice. Emphasis is placed on students increasing their awareness of the patient as a whole through the concept of patient-centred care. This involves the development of professional ethics, communication and problem-solving skills through tutorials, workshops and reflective activities. To present a clinical perspective, the pharmacology and pharmacotherapy of major disease states are delivered in an integrated fashion. This provides students with a practical understanding of how theoretical knowledge is applied to patients and provides an in-depth look into the pharmacists' role in management of these disease states. A case-based approach to learning will ensure that the student focus is on the key learning outcomes.

Topics include the autonomic nervous system, pain, cardiology, respiratory medicine and diabetes. Simulated pharmacy practice sessions continue to develop both the integration of knowledge with practice and the students' communication skills.</td>

This unit continues to explore the role of the pharmacist introduced in PHCY5601 Introduction to Pharmacy Practice and PHCY5606 Foundations of Primary Care.</p><p>To present a clinical perspective, the pharmacology and pharmacotherapy of major disease states are delivered in an integrated fashion. This provides students with a practical understanding of how theoretical knowledge is applied to patients and provides an in-depth look at the pharmacists’ role in management of these disease states. To fully understand how drugs work, general pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic principles will be introduced. Experts in various specialty areas teach the pharmacy practice perspective. Topics include the autonomic nervous system, pain management, cardiology, respiratory medicine and diabetes. </p><p>This unit will focus on the role of the pharmacist as a health care professional, applying knowledge about disease processes and their management through evidence-based practice to the delivery of healthcare to the community. Emphasis is placed on students increasing their awareness of the patient as a whole through the concept of patient-centred care. It includes consideration of the relationship of the pharmacist with other healthcare professionals. This involves communication skills, problem-solving skills, integration of knowledge with practice through simulated pharmacy practice sessions, tutorials, workshops, mentor lead sessions, case-based studies and reflective activities.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

The pharmacology and pharmacotherapy of different disease states will delivered in an integrated fashion. Lecturers will use cases to illustrate their practice area. </p><p>Simulated learning tutorials allow practise of communication skills and integration of clinical knowledge with clinical tutors and peer tutors. Non-contact time during SL tutorials has been time-tabled to provide you with the opportunity to work in small groups and with your mentors. Learning details about some drugs off by heart is unavoidable, however using group time to practise your drug knowledge will greatly assist with retention of this information. Students who effectively work in their small groups report of the benefits of this particularly in the reduction of stress prior to assessments.</p><p>Drugflash is an app developed for the UWA MPharm program to help you recall correct drug facts. The drug lists have been organised in trimesters and is available via drugflash.app </p><p>A reflective component is included to develop a means for you to monitor and better understand your knowledge and understanding. Reflection is essential for deeper learning and for self-awareness that is required for professional growth.</p></p></pre></p>

In addition, external experts are invited and a full audience is their expectation. All lectures delivered by guest lecturers are compulsory. All mentor sessions, simulated learning tutorials and case-based workshops are compulsory; with at least 80% attendance rate required. Students must arrive in time to sign-in prior to the session commencing. Microsoft Teams sessions are compulsory attendance and a roll will be taken. Please note: it is considered professional behaviour to attend all sessions on time.</p><p>If a student is unable to attend a session they will need to discuss this with the Unit Coordinator. If a student is unable to attend a session due to illness or for any other exceptional circumstance, the Unit Coordinator must be contacted as soon as practicable. Absences of more than one day due to illness will require a medical certificate to be presented. Failure to meet this requirement may/will result in a report of Professional Misconduct being made.</p><p>Name badges are compulsory for all Pharmacy Practice sessions – the tutors and lecturers use a problem based learning style where you need to participate in discussions in class and it is important that the tutor can refer to you by your name.</p><p><strong>Preparation</strong></p><p>Many sessions will involve preparation beforehand to enhance the learning experience. Please ensure this preparation is completed. If for some reason the preparation cannot be completed, discuss this in advance with the Unit Coordinator. Sessional staff will be asked to report back to the Unit Coordinator if preparation is not completed at an acceptable level.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
