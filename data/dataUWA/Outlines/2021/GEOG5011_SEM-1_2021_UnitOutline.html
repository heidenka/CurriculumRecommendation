Students work independently on their research project and meet with their supervisor(s) on a regular basis to discuss progress/challenges etc.</p><p>As a research-based unit, it is structured as follows:</p><p>CHOOSING A DISSERTATION TOPIC</p><p>Settling on a specific topic and a supervisor is the primary task of students in the early phase of dissertation process. Once your eligibility to enrol in the dissertation is confirmed, please contact your Program Coordinator as soon as possible to discuss your topic interests and prospective supervisors. Building on your knowledge and skills developed in MIXD5005 Designing Social Research, a number of factors may influence your decision on a dissertation topic:</p><p>• What topics are of particular interest to you?</p><p>• Which units have you found most interesting?</p><p>• What sorts of research have you enjoyed doing?</p><p>The dissertation topic must be of direct relevance to your program and should be broadly within your prospective supervisor’s area of expertise. Once you have obtained your final MIXD5005 results, it will be imperative to be matched, via your Program Coordinator, with a supervisor to make the best use of the summer/winter non-class period by commencing your dissertation research. Students should not commence the dissertation without having confirmed a supervisor via their program Coordinator.</p><p>The research/supervision interests and expertise of current UWA School of Social Sciences staff can be viewed here: <a href='https://www.uwa.edu.au/able/schools/school-of-social-sciences' target='_blank' >https://www.uwa.edu.au/able/schools/school-of-social-sciences</a></p><p>Ethics clearance: If the project involves interviews and public consultation you may</p><p>need to obtain UWA Human Research Ethics approval. Discuss this with your supervisor and decide whether your topic requires ethics approval. See: <a href='http://www.research.uwa.edu.au/staff/human-research/welcome-to-HREO' target='_blank' >http://www.research.uwa.edu.au/staff/human-research/welcome-to-HREO</a></p><p>THE SUPERVISOR</p><p>Supervision is the action of overseeing and mentoring of research work by an academic staff member. An effective working relationship between a student and a supervisor is considered essential to the development and completion of a good research dissertation. The School is committed to ensuring that all students are given the opportunity to develop and maximise their potential during their enrolment. Students will have the best chance of performing to their potential if they take full advantage of the opportunities afforded by their supervisors and if an effective working relationship is established between supervisor and student.</p><p>It is the supervisor’s task to help you devise a manageable topic and viable research plan, building on your knowledge and skills developed in SOCS5003 Research Design. The topic needs to be well defined, related to a body of literature, able to be researched with the resources and time available, and capable of being dealt with in 15-18,000 words (depending on your individual course). It is the task of the supervisor to act as intelligent critic and to give advice on the argument, or thesis, the analysis, and the organization of the dissertation. You should meet with your supervisor not less than once per month, and probably every 2-3 weeks. You should work out a schedule of future meetings with your supervisor during your first meeting. Your supervisor will not play any role in formally examining your dissertation.</p><p>Responsibilities of Supervisors: Supervisors are responsible for providing</p><p>academic guidance to students and for fostering an environment in which students can maximise their potential. The role of a Supervisor requires:</p><p>• meeting with the students at least monthly;</p><p>• working with the student to clarify expectations at the outset of the enrolment;</p><p>• For GEOG students, what topics/supervisors are currently available?</p><p>• discussing with the student, at the outset, relevant issues of research conduct;</p><p>• suggesting ways in which the student can make the most effective use of time;</p><p>• recognising personal strengths and limitations and identifying situations in which a student needs to be referred to colleagues for assistance;</p><p>• committing the time necessary to allow for maintaining the close and regular contact with the student and establishing at the outset the basis on which contact will be made;</p><p>• requiring work from the student on a pre-arranged and agreed schedule;</p><p>• monitoring the progress of the work in accordance with the agreed schedule;</p><p>• discussing the progress towards, and any impediments to, maintaining the agreed schedule, with the student;</p><p>• monitoring the performance of the student relative to the standard required for the programme, and ensuring that inadequate progress or work below the standard generally expected is brought to the student’s attention, and if necessary to the Program Coordinator;</p><p>• commenting on the content and drafts of work.</p><p>Responsibilities of Students: Students have a number of roles and responsibilities</p><p>that contribute to the overall success and satisfaction of the program:</p><p>• being thoroughly familiar with the various procedures, including human research ethics if applicable;</p><p>• preparing submissions relating to the program;</p><p>• discussing with the supervisor the type of help considered most useful, and keeping to an agreed schedule of meetings which will ensure regular contact;</p><p>• taking the initiative in raising problems or difficulties;</p><p>• maintaining the progress of the work in accordance with the stages agreed with the supervisor, including the presentation of required work in sufficient time to allow for comments and discussion before proceeding to the next stage;</p><p>• discussing progress towards, and impediments to, maintaining the agreed timetable with the supervisor.</p><p>• See: <a href='http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/experience/charter' target='_blank' >http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/experience/charter</a></p><p>DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR DISSERTATION</p><p>There are several key reporting obligations to allow your supervisor and Program Coordinator to monitor your progress during the dissertation process:</p><p>By the end of Week 3 (full-time enrolment) or end of Week 6 (part-time) of semester, you are required to submit via email to your Program Coordinator a simple ‘one pager’ containing your working dissertation title, the name of your supervisor, and a short outline of your topic and the approach taken, including an indication of key primary and secondary source material. This is just to check that you are on track and have confirmed a supervisor, and it is not assessed.</p><p>You should then submit a full draft of your dissertation to your supervisor not less than three weeks prior to the final submission deadline (see below). Dissertations are often underwritten in the sense that too little time is spent revising them to ensure the argument is fully developed and clearly stated. It is of great benefit to get your supervisor’s comments on a full draft of your thesis in time for final editing and polishing. Supervisors cannot be expected to read and comment on drafts mere days before the submission date. Nor can students make full use of such comments in this time frame.<br></p></p></pre></p>

                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>

                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>

                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
