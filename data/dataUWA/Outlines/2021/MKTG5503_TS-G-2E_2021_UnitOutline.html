The nature of enterprise behaviour and the characteristics of entrepreneurs in both large and small organisations are examined, as are the policy issues associated with encouraging enterprise and innovation within large organisations and the wider community. Students examine their own propensity for enterprise and creativity, while exploring the nature and process of innovation. They are provided with an understanding of how technology and innovation are distinct but related constructs, as well as the psychological, social and cultural forces influencing new venture creation. The fundamentals of opportunity recognition and screening of new venture ideas are examined from both a macro and micro perspective. Commercialisation, IP management and the financing of entrepreneurial ventures are also addressed.</td>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>This unit is about ENTERPRISE and focuses on entrepreneurism and innovation. The content gives attention to understanding entrepreneurial thinking and what is required to build or develop new business ventures and promoting growth and newness in existing firms. Innovation is about everything, not just about new technology, i.e. there are products, services, and also processes, for example, a new way to market goods, services, and processes. Why do we do this? We do this to enhance value for the company's customers, employees, shareholders, and society.</p><p>Successful entrepreneurism is the cohesive undertaking of creativity and idea development, planning, implementing, and risk-taking. Together, we will study what entrepreneurs do to develop their own entrepreneurial awareness and engage in analytical and creative skills. <strong>Rest assured that entrepreneurial management skills and know-how will make you a much sought-after business professional as well as a business owner if you wish to own a business.</strong></p><p>Entrepreneurism can be taught and must also be experienced (i.e. practiced). A distinction also needs to be made between the entrepreneur as an individual, being enterprising as a person, and the processes of doing business. Entrepreneurs can lead large companies, however, most start out leading small companies with little initial capital.</p><p>Entrepreneurism is frequently associated with innovation. Innovation is often associated with entrepreneurs, but it is also a concept with its own dynamics. Innovations can involve radical or evolutionary changes and may or may not involve technology. Within business, innovation is usually associated with product, service, or process technologies that serve to add value or lower the cost to access. Innovation can also involve enhancements to the way a business system is structured, workplaces are designed, markets are accessed or company finances are managed. Innovators can be equally diverse and those who can blend innovation together with entrepreneurship are likely to profoundly shape the future of their industries.</p><p><strong>Unit goals</strong></p><p>This unit aims to give you an overview of the theory, practice, and context of entrepreneurship and innovation at both an industry level and a company level. This unit will provide you with a foundation of ideas and understandings that are designed to shape your thinking and behavior so as to appreciate the role of innovation and entrepreneurship in modern economies. </p><p>As a postgraduate student, we hope you will gain a better understanding of your own entrepreneurial capacity and recognize that enterprising behavior can be found in all people regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, or socio-economic background. It is possible to unlock the creativity and ingenuity in individuals and groups by being exposed to the lessons of how others have achieved success. You acquire new tools and conceptual frameworks that can help you approach such entrepreneurial tasks as new venture creation or innovation management, even within existing organizations.</p><p>This unit is primarily based on a process and action-oriented approach. You, and any would-be entrepreneurs, effectively learn only by taking part in the process, and evidence shows that "practice by doing" induces the highest retention rate. Therefore, the course will include a mix of lectures, case studies, entrepreneur testimonies, and a comprehensive business case development.</p></p></pre></p>

It does not matter what discipline you follow, entrepreneurism and innovation is in nearly all we do. However, to achieve this requires substantial input mostly from the student with the assistance of the teacher.  </p><p>Why the student? Because <strong>entrepreneurial thinking and doing comes from the heart and the mind</strong>. It is an enjoyable act because as we said earlier, we do this to enhance value to others; customers, employees, shareholders, and the wider communities in which we live. </p><p>I hope you will also find this unit challenging and intellectually stimulating.  The focus of learning within the unit will be upon investigation and analysis, making use of case studies, small group discussion, and reporting. Lectures will provide a structural framework and there will be a strong emphasis placed upon group learning and student participation. The most effective learning takes place when students are required to apply their learning or teach others. </p><p>You will get the most out of this unit if you follow lectures attentively by actively listening to and understanding deeply what is being expressed. If in doubt, please ask anytime, directly or via email. I promise to do my utmost as a lecturer, and for you, as a student, you are prepared to read the text as required, listen to and write questions to ask during the dedicated time for this activity. Apply your learning and knowledge to your assessments wisely and authoritatively. The design of this unit aims to provide you with all these elements, including assisting an entrepreneur seeking to introduce a new innovation, where you can practice by doing and teach others the things you have learned.</p></p></pre></p>

The EndNote software package is a really good system for building up a database of references. Not everyone will want to invest the time in using this system but you should consider it if you intend to build up resource materials or plan to undertake extensive research in a particular area. The library staff have also developed a tutoring package: ‘A Quick Guide to Using EndNote’ which provides the basics for using EndNote with an essay <a href='http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote' target='_blank' >http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/endnote</a></p></p></pre></p>
