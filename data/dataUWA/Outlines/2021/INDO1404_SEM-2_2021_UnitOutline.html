It develops basic social proficiency in both formal and informal Indonesian. Using a variety of text types, students develop their ability to discuss daily life in Australia and Indonesia, focusing on Indonesian society and culture. They widen their vocabulary and their understanding of sophisticated linguistic structures. Students are introduced to the conventions of informal speech in Indonesian, using largely video material from Indonesian films and television but also youth magazines. Their writing skills are also further developed through essay writing exercises. They are expected to be able to operate relatively capably in social situations in Indonesia, demonstrating comprehension of formal and informal speech in Indonesian, providing information and expressing opinions. The unit enables students to achieve 'basic social proficiency' in Indonesian or Level 2 of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (Elaine Wylie and D. E. Ingram, Griffith University, 1995).</td>

It develops basic social proficiency in both formal and informal Indonesian. Using a variety of text types, students develop their ability to discuss daily life in Australia and Indonesia, focusing on Indonesian society and culture. They widen their vocabulary and their understanding of sophisticated linguistic structures. Students are introduced to the conventions of informal speech in Indonesian, using largely video material from Indonesian films and television but also youth magazines. Their writing skills are also further developed through essay writing exercises. They are expected to be able to operate relatively capably in social situations in Indonesia, demonstrating comprehension of formal and informal speech in Indonesian, providing information and expressing opinions.</p><p>Outcomes: This unit is designed to enable students to achieve 'basic social proficiency' in Indonesian or Level 2 of the International Second Language Proficiency Ratings (Elaine Wylie and D. E. Ingram, Griffith University, 1995). </p><p>Successfully completing this unit should enable you to </p><p>1	have a general understanding of common cultural aspects of Indonesian life; provide information and express opinions in spoken Indonesian and achieve 'social proficiency' (Level 2+) as defined by the International Second Language Proficiency Rating; </p><p>2	engage in simple discussions about some aspects of social life in Indonesia and Australia; engage in conversations about daily life in Indonesia and Australia;</p><p>3	demonstrate comprehension of formal and informal speech in Indonesian; provide information and express opinions in spoken Indonesian</p><p>4	translate academic Indonesian texts on Indonesian society and culture into English using a dictionary; provide information and express opinions in written Indonesian (e.g. essays); demonstrate formal and informal written Indonesian;</p></p></pre></p>

We will use this combination model with lots of activities of speaking, viewing and listening, reading comprehension and writing.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the three contact classes, other activities are as follows.</p><p><strong>Out-of-class Work &amp; Assignment Details</strong><br></p><p>Non-contact/home study consists of the following:</p><p><i>1. Preparation for class</i></p><p>You should be prepared for all the work listed in the Unit Outline PRIOR to class. This means you should read the relevant sections of the text and Reader.  In addition, you should note any difficult or puzzling language or content, to ask about in class.  You will also be required to complete exercises as homework as we go. In addition, you will be required to do regular Listening Exercises as part of the assessment.</p><p>Supplementary material and additional instructions may be provided as we go. Therefore make sure you check your official student email inbox and LMS regularly.</p><p><i>2. Weekly Listening Exercises	 Due weekly (Weeks 1-6)</i></p><p>These are listed in the Unit Outline each week.  Listen to the relevant tracks on LMS each week. Each week you are required to listen and complete the comprehension and language exercises listed. In most cases, the tasks are to be submitted in Tuesday Class of each week.</p><p><i>3. Dialogue or sketch (Week 8)</i></p><p>Out of class preparation for the dialogue or sketch performed in pairs and without notes in front of the class. This exercise takes place in Week 8 and makes up 5% of your marks for the unit, so make sure you do not leave your preparation to the last minute.</p><p><i>4. Modern Politics, History or Culture Assignment	 </i></p><p>Due: Tuesday, Week 10</p><p>You are required to find and submit an article or passage in Indonesian (around 800 words) </p><p>about an aspect of modern Indonesian politics, history or culture of interest to you.  Submit:</p><p>•	a copy of the article/passage, including source;</p><p>•	an Indonesian-English word list for the article (key words);</p><p>•	a summary of the article in note form (in English)</p><p>•	your reasons for choosing the article/passage (200 words in Indonesian).</p><p>Your written work must be typed and double spaced on A4 paper.  Please submit a hard copy with a signed cover sheet to Theresia Seputro in the class on Wednesday 12 October.). However late submission may attract deductions of marks. </p><p>See Helpful Websites section for sources.</p><p>You must also present your assignment orally to the class in Weeks 11/12.  It should be 5-10 minutes in length. The presentation should be communicative. You should not merely be reading your notes, but must speak on your topic and gain the interest of the audience; this may require some initial vocabulary clarification so the audience understands the key points. Make copies of your presentation and the vocab clarification available for the whole class. You will be marked on how well you deliver/present the material so as to engage the audience (this may include the use of multimedia), on your language use, voice clarity &amp; pronunciation, as well as the content of your summary and reasons for choosing the article. You may need to expand beyond your essay and discuss your topic in more depth.</p><p><i>5. Additional Study and Practice</i></p><p>Take every opportunity to practise your Indonesian and to listen to it being spoken!  If you are having trouble with some aspect of the language, let your lecturer/tutor know.</p><p>6. Study Techniques</p><p>The key to passing this unit will be prior preparation.  If you are well-prepared for each session, the language learning process will be made easier.  Without adequate preparation, frustration and self-doubt will inevitably result.  Vary your study techniques as much as possible to ensure you utilise as many intellectual facilities as you can, e.g. write, read, read aloud, recite, do exercises, use synonyms, extend ideas with "karena"-type additions, speak with friends in Indonesian as much as possible, ask "what if"-type questions, think about what your opinion/other people's opinions about ideas may be, and then write or say them.  There are many study techniques.  including:</p><p>•	practising with a classmate		these activities will help you develop </p><p>•	finding an Indonesian friend 		spontaneity in conversations.</p><p>•	browsing/joining Indonesian blogs, online communities (e.g. Facebook), etc.		 </p><p>•	Watch occasional Indonesian lessons on TV (channel 31) or movies &amp; news (SBS).</p><p>•	Watch Indonesian posts on YouTube</p><p>•	Listen to Indonesian radio on the internet via <a href='http://www.radioguide.fm/internet-radio-indonesia/' target='_blank' >http://www.radioguide.fm/internet-radio-indonesia/</a></p><p>•	Borrow Indonesian films from the library.</p></p></pre></p>

Failing to attend at other times will result in poor marks for class participation so it is recommended that students attend all classes.  Marks of 0-100% will be awarded for your general participation in all activities, not just for the specific assessment items. There are various activities, such as spontaneous conversations, speaking, reading comprehension, viewing, and listening.</p><p>Effective participation in the unit requires that you devote a minimum of ten hours per week to learning activities. These consist of three contact hours and at least seven hours of non-contact or home study. Thus, for every class you should be doing a minimum additional two hours of study.</p><p>- In accordance with Faculty regulations, any student who does not make satisfactory progress in the course may be excluded from taking the final examination.</p><p>- A penalty of 5 per cent of the possible mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays), after which the assigned work is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due. For example, a student, who has submitted a piece of work for an assessment item late by three days and was scored a mark of 45 out of a possible mark of 50, receives after penalty a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day as a penalty for each student from the mark obtained). Where there are several tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied holistically to the assessment item after all tasks have been completed. If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course. </p><p>- Students may not submit a piece of work twice, either in the Unit or from other Units. Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p></p></pre></p>

The Harvard referencing style is also known as the "author date" system because you must cite both the author and publication date. There is no definitive version of Harvard available.)The library will provide online guides, EndNote styles and support for the prescribed coursework (undergraduate and postgraduate) referencing styles.All coursework students complete ACE and CARS</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research".
