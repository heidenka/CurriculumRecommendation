Emphasis is placed on inquiry learning, utilising a 'hands-on, minds-on' approach to engage children. The role of evidence in science is discussed. The important place of prior knowledge in children's science learning is explored with an emphasis on the relationship between everyday concepts and scientific concepts. Students become familiar with the three curriculum strands: science understanding (biological sciences, chemical sciences, earth and space sciences, physical sciences); science inquiry skills; and science as a human endeavour of the Australian curriculum: science. Students also become familiar with the place of science within the Early Years Learning Framework. Students develop understanding of integrating mathematics with science. Students begin to develop a resource file and professional library as a means of developing their own science content knowledge.</td>

Parts of this unit involve a flipped mode - where work MUST be completed before coming to class. You are asked to be fully prepared for each workshop by ensuring that you have completed all required work or readings. You are also expected to be an active participant in each workshop, whether this be performing hands-on activities, group discussion or class discussion.<br></p><p>The aim of this unit is to enable pre-service teachers to develop their knowledge and skills for the effective teaching of Science, with an emphasis on the use of an integrated curriculum. Curriculum integration allows teachers to transcend subject and disciplinary areas, developing integrative activities that are not restricted with subject or discipline. In curriculum integration, schedules revolve around projects and activities rather than subject areas. Research has shown that integration increases student's motivation, attitudes and allows them to see relationships between concepts (or learning areas) in more meaningful ways. Thus, students develop greater understanding of how the world operates, rather than treating learning areas as separate and unrelated entities.</p><p>Within this unit you will analyse key features of the Science Learning Area of the Australian Curriculum and related documents; appraise a range of teaching, learning and assessment strategies suitable for Science at the early childhood and primary school level; plan and sequence teaching and learning experiences appropriate for early childhood and primary students that achieve the outcomes from the Science Learning Area; critique both disciplinary and integrated approaches to teaching and learning in drawing on Science, STEM and sustainability; and begin to build a resource file and professional library as a means of developing your understanding of integrated planning and teaching.</p><p>Please see LMS for full details.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

Group activities and discussion are important components of the science workshops, and we are confident that all members will feel able to contribute.</p><p>Engaging in reading the literature will also be important in developing and refining knowledge and skills. Specific readings have been set for most weeks. It is important that you are familiar with the readings so that you can take part in group discussions and workshop activities. We encourage you to find alternative readings, particularly from recent publications, so that you can access the most current literature on research and practice of the teaching, learning and assessment in early childhood and primary schooling.</p><p>Attendance at all classes is strongly encouraged. If you are unable to make class, you should let the unit coordinator know.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

It is critical for teachers of science to consider the children that they will be teaching, in particular their conceptual understandings about the topic that is going to be the focus of the teaching and learning sequence. Research suggests that young students have many beginning ideas and alternative conceptions about science concepts. Thus, when teachers are planning a program they must take these into consideration. Please see LMS for a full description of this assignment, which is summarised below.</p><p>Select one of the case studies presented on LMS under Assignment 1/Case studies which present children's views on particular science topics.</p><p>Provide a referenced rationale as to why it is necessary to obtain children’s prior knowledge in science. This should introduce and discuss alternatives conceptions in learning.</p><p>Research and report on the science behind the chosen science topic. This is to ensure that you have gained a sufficient understanding of the content.</p><p>Review the literature to find out children’s alternative conceptions about your science topic and report these findings.</p><p>Summarise the alternative conceptions and scientific concepts that the case study child held and compare with the published literature.</p><p>Select the most significant alternative conception found with the child. Describe two activities that could be used to challenge this alternative conception.

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/policy?policy=UP07%252F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "honest, ethical and responsible scholarship". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="https://www.uwa.edu.au/library/Find-resources/ACE">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
