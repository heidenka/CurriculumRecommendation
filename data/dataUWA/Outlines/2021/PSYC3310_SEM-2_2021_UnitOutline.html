Note, however, that the mode of unit delivery may change (e.g., online lectures only; online labs only; online assessments only). Furthermore, additional online resources may also be made available to students (e.g., online recordings and online Q&amp;A sessions with teaching staff). In the event that COVID-19 restrictions are imposed, more precise details will be made known to students via LMS announcements.</p></p>

Students will learn about the research process and scientific communication in a series of common lectures, and the theoretical context and research methodologies relevant to their research topic in stream specific lectures. The research project will actively engage students in formulating and implementing an experimental approach to a research question. The unit gives students the opportunity to explore issues of contemporary psychology in depth and to acquire skills in areas such as research design and written communication that prepare them for advanced study in psychology.</td>

We pay our respects to their Elders both past and present.</p><p>This unit is taught by a series of lectures (Mondays 11am-1pm) and lab classes. In the lectures, students will learn research skills relevant to conducting research in psychological science and will gain in-depth knowledge of current research in two areas of staff expertise. In the lab classes, students will work on a research project designed to examine the potential links between these areas. Students will be actively engaged in formulating a research question, learning how to set up a research study, data collection, data cleaning and analysis, and developing report writing skills. The unit gives students the opportunity to explore issues of contemporary psychology in depth and to acquire skills in areas such as research design and written communication that prepare them for advanced study in psychology.</p><p>The first lecture of each week will teach generic research skills to the unit as a whole. For the second lecture, students will split into smaller topic specific lectures that will teach content and research methods specific to their chosen research topic. The smaller topic specific lectures are designed to enable interaction between students and the academic staff members delivering the material. These lectures will be recorded and available through the LMS but students are expected to attend the lectures to take the opportunity to engage with the academic staff. The lab classes will involve active participation relevant to the research project and students must have viewed the relevant lectures and completed any pre-lab activities prior to attending their lab class. Lab classes will not be recorded. Attendance at all classes is expected.</p></p></pre></p>

Active and inquiry-based learning is promoted through discussion, information gathering, problem solving and analysis. You will work closely with a number of academic staff members and your peers throughout the semester in order to review the literature relevant to the research topic, learn how to set up a research study, prepare, collect and analyse real data, and produce a research report based on the findings. You will also be expected to work in groups to prepare a research proposal and an ethics application. Active participation in all aspects of this unit is strongly encouraged.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p><strong>Lectures:</strong> 24 x 1 hours (Mondays 11am - 1pm, recordings will be made available on the LMS shortly afterwards)</p><p><strong>Lab classes:</strong> 6 x 2 hours (Weeks 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 - see Preparation column in Unit Schedule below)</p><p><strong>Project work:</strong> Approximately 30 hours of project work outside of lectures/labs</p><p><strong>Assessment Items</strong></p><p><strong>Mid-Semester Test:</strong> The mid-semester test will be held on Monday 23rd Aug (Week 5). The test will consist of multiple-choice questions based on the material presented in the lectures during Weeks 1-4 and any associated readings set by the lecturers. The test will be conducted online via LMS and you will be able to complete it at any time between 8am to 5pm on that day. </p><p><strong>Research proposal:</strong> The research proposal should briefly outline the proposed research. It should be no more than 1200 words in length (excluding the abstract (max 150 words), any figures or tables, and the reference list) and is a joint product of the research group (i.e., one research proposal submitted per group). Marking will cease once the word limit is reached. One group member will need to take responsibility for submitting the  research proposal on behalf of the group via LMS. The research proposal will be assessed by a member of academic staff and all group members will receive the same mark for the research proposal.</p><p><strong>Ethics application:</strong> The ethics application needs to be completed using the appropriate form (available on LMS) and should detail the proposed experimental procedures and responses to any ethical concerns or issues. Appropriate information sheets and consent forms should also be included. The ethics application should be completed by the research group and submitted via LMS (i.e., one ethics application submitted per group). The ethics application will be assessed by a member of academic staff and all group members will receive the same mark for the ethics application.</p><p><strong>Research report:</strong> The research report should be written according to the format outlined in the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (7th Edition), and must not exceed 2500 words in length excluding the abstract (max 150 words), figures, tables, and the reference list. Marking will cease once the word limit is reached. The research report is an individual assessment and should not contain material taken from the research proposal. Excessive similarity between the research proposal and your individual report will be identified by the plagiarism detection software and reported to the academic misconduct advisor. The research report should be submitted via LMS and will be marked by your demonstrator.</p><p><strong>Group work log:</strong> This unit involves working together in a group to discuss the design and methodology of the proposed research project, create a research proposal for the project, and detail the ethical considerations associated with the project. Learning to work with others is a valuable skill that you will need once you enter the workforce, but it is also an opportunity to form strong bonds with your peers as you work towards your Honours year. You are expected to contribute to all group-based project work. The contribution of each student to group work will be monitored by the academic staff and demonstrator delivering your lab class. If you feel that someone in your group is not contributing their fair share, you should inform the unit coordinator at least 10 days prior to any group work assessment deadline. This will enable the unit coordinator to address any issues with the group prior to  the deadline. Students who are not deemed to be contributing to their group project may be asked to provide evidence of their contribution. In addition, groups will be asked to maintain and submit a group work log that details their activities as a group and the contribution of each group member to the project. The aim of this is to help keep your group work on track and to document the contributions of group members. The group work log should be completed by the research group and submitted via LMS (i.e., one group work log submitted per group). Your ability to work as a group will be evaluated based on this document.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

In the lectures, you will learn about the background literature relevant to the research project and research skills relevant to conducting research in psychological science. In lab classes, you will be applying these skills as you develop a research question, learn how to set up a research study, collect data, and analyse and report the results of the research project. Some of this work will be conducted in small groups in the lab classes. Failure to attend the lectures and lab classes will result in you missing key aspects of the design and analysis process and will impede your contribution to the group work components and your ability to complete the mid-semester test and the final research report. You are expected to actively participate in discussions and activities to ensure your understanding of the content and techniques being taught.&nbsp;</p></p></pre></p>

You are expected to be familiar with the University's guidelines and policies regarding academic conduct, available at <a href='http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct' target='_blank' >http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct</a> . Please note that the research proposal is a group-based assessment and the research report is an individual assessment. As such, you should be careful to avoid using material from the research proposal in your individual report. Excessive similarity between the research proposal and your individual report will be identified by the plagiarism detection software and reported to the academic misconduct advisor. Some similarity in the Method and Results sections is expected across reports and will not be identified as problematic, however, even these sections should not be identical to those in another student's report. Referencing should be in accordance with APA 7th edition. A library guide for the APA 7th Ed. can be found here <a href='https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/apa' target='_blank' >https://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/apa</a>.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
