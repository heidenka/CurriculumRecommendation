The unit examines identity and worldview and the wider society's attitudes towards Aboriginal people and what people mean when they speak of 'Aboriginal education'. Students are asked to critically reflect on how they locate themselves, their world views and perceptions within Aboriginal Education. The unit will examine historical relationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia and the impact of colonisation, governmental policies and practices on all aspects of life and, in particular, education. 'Aboriginal education' is considered in the context of social justice and Indigenous and human rights issues which continue to affect Aboriginal people and their relationships with the wider Australian community. The focus of this unit is to help develop cultural understandings that will enable teachers to embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives and draw on strategies that are culturally responsive within an educational context.</td>

The unit examines identity and worldview and the wider society's attitudes towards Aboriginal people and what people mean when they speak of 'Aboriginal education'. Students are asked to critically reflect on how they locate themselves, their world views and perceptions within Aboriginal Education. The unit will examine historical relationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia and the impact of colonisation, governmental policies and practices on all aspects of life and in particular, education. 'Aboriginal education' is considered in the context of social justice and Indigenous and human rights issues which continue to affect Aboriginal people and their relationships with the wider Australian community. The focus of this unit is to help develop cultural understandings that will enable teachers to embed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives and draw on strategies that are culturally responsive within an educational context.</p><p><strong><i>This unit focuses on the Graduate APSTs [Australian Professional Standards for Teaching] 1.4 and 2.4 and is also linked to APSTs 1.5, 3.7, 4.1, 7.3 and 7.4</i></strong></p><p>1.4 Graduate – Strategies for teaching Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students: Demonstrate broad knowledge and understanding of the impact of culture, cultural identity and linguistic background on the education of students from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories, culture and languages.</p><p>2.4 Graduate – Understand and respect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to promote reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians: Demonstrate a broad knowledge of, understanding of and respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories, cultures and languages.</p><p>1.5 Graduate - Differentiate teaching to meet the specific learning needs of students across the full range of abilities: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of strategies for differentiating teaching to meet the specific learning needs of students across the full range of abilities</p><p>3.7 Graduate - Engage parents/carers in the educative process: Describe a broad range of strategies for involving parents/carers in the educative process.</p><p>4.1 Graduate - Support student participation: Identify strategies to support inclusive student participation and engagement in classroom activities.</p><p>7.3 Graduate - Engage with the parents/carers: Understand strategies for working effectively, sensitively and confidentially with parents/carers</p><p>7.4 Graduate – Engage with Professional Teaching Networks and Broader Communities: Understand the role of external professionals and community representatives in broadening teachers’ professional knowledge and practice</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h3>Learning And Teaching Strategy</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>The Teaching and Learning Strategy of this unit based on a variety of current teaching and learning strategies which will assist in preparing pre-service teachers to teach in diverse and technological educational spaces. The unit design follows principles of the ‘flipped classroom”. You can access this link for more information on ‘Flipped Classrooms” <a href='https://www.adelaide.edu.au/flipped-classroom/about/' target='_blank' >https://www.adelaide.edu.au/flipped-classroom/about/</a>.</p><p>Online preparation tasks, lectures, workshops and learning on Country are the learning designs in EDUC5429. It is expected that you will develop and enhance your knowledge by engaging in the learning opportunities throughout the unit. The engagements will reflect the values as expressed in cross-cultural learning environments in which a key component is critical reflection based on preparation and willingness to share what is known at that moment. Attention is focused on acquiring knowledge through engagement in online and face to face activities, discussion and sharing.</p><p>These learning strategies are an opportunity for you to develop your professionalism, especially in the context of working in schools. It is important for you to practice maintaining high standards of professional conduct and commitment throughout the unit, this will be reflected in your attitudes to learning and behaviours as you engage in the learning offered.</p><p><strong>ISE – Indigenous Studies Essentials:</strong> Week ‘O’ Entry Task for Aboriginal Perspectives in Education and ISE on the main menu.</p><p>Complete the ISE module before week 1 workshop as an introduction or a refresher (ISE link is on LMS) (approx. 1-2hours to complete). The ISE module is an introduction or reflection of some essential Indigenous understandings which will assist in familiarising you with the context of this unit.</p><p><strong>Pre-Recorded Lectures</strong></p><p>Weekly pre-recorded lectures will be presented by the unit coordinator and professionals/educators from Aboriginal Education sectors in education who are knowledgeable in the specific topic. These are included as a part of your Online Workshop Preparation tasks. See weekly folders in Learning Materials on LMS and also Lecture Recordings in the main menu.</p><p><strong>Online Preparation Tasks </strong>– See weekly folders in Learning Materials on LMS</p><p>Weekly online pre-workshop preparation tasks which include: viewing the pre-recorded lecture, a self assessed quiz to review the key lecture points; guided reading components (article extracts or a full article); guided viewing components (each video ranging from 10mins to 45mins duration); diagram or notes pertaining to reading/viewing to bring to the workshop for the workshop activity; discussion board post based on a set question connecting with the guided reading/viewing (roughly 100 words).</p><p><strong>Workshops</strong></p><p>A dialogic and transformative learning approach is fundamental to the workshop design of this unit (for you own information <a href='http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1002.9078&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf' target='_blank' >http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1002.9078&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a>). Workshops will be interactive using both activity based and dialogic approaches. To be able to engage in the classroom dialogue and activities students will need to reflect on and analyse their understandings the content/points in unit materials provided in online preparation tasks on LMS and in seminars. A dialogic and transformative learning approach requires students to reflect on and share understandings and perspectives about the unit content/points being raised. Critical reflective components of the activities and the dialogic approaches are designed stimulate students’ transformative learning and facilitate deeper understandings.</p><p>At the end of each class, a review process of the content covered will include students completing a Padlet post. </p><p>To be able to engage fully in your learning ensure you prepare for your workshops by completing the Online Preparation Tasks on LMS and by accessing the weekly workshop guide.</p><p><strong>Workshop Guides</strong></p><p>Workshop guides have been designed to provide some background information on the week’s content. It would be beneficial to consult the workshop guide as it also sets out all your tasks or information for Workshop components for each week.</p><p><strong>Learning on Country - Excursion</strong></p><p>Learning on Country is a significant component of learning for Indigenous students/peoples and also for non-Indigenous students/peoples’ learning. Country encompasses more than just the physical environment, it is knowledge, the ancestors, kin/people and spiritual. Learning on Country is a way of learning through connecting with Country and the knowledge within Country.</p><p>Please note: students will need to attend and participate in all Online Preparation Tasks, Pre-recorded Lecture, Workshops and Excursions. Clashes with timetabling and or other unit requirements will need to be solved prior to this core unit’s commencement.</p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
