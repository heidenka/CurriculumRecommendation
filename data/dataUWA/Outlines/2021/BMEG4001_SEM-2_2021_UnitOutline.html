                                    <td>In this unit, students will primarily apply knowledge of electronic engineering principles to the design and development of bioinstrumentation. A main focus of the unit will be to combine knowledge of bioinstrumentation with lab-based learning, ensuring students gain practical experience of bioinstrumentation, focussed in the area of biophotonics. Students will take a hands-on approach to explore each step in the development and implementation of bioinstrumentation from the physiological parameter measured and the mechanism used to interpret the measured data, to how the physician uses this information. Key aspects of the unit include: 
1.	A detailed analysis of how light is applied for diagnosis and therapy in bioinstrumentation, including the underlying physics of how light propagates in tissue and how this interaction assists in the treatment of various diseases and medical conditions.
2.	An analysis of biopotentials and how they are used in techniques such as electrocardiography. 
3.	Analogue and digital circuitry used to condition detected biomedical signals.
4.	Core aspects of biomedical signal processing.
5.	A detailed description and analysis of specific bioinstruments, including noise and safety considerations.</td>

                    <h3>Unit Information</h3>
                    <p><pre style='background-color:FFFFFF;padding: 0; margin - bottom: 12px; font - family: "Source Sans Pro", sans - serif; font - weight: 400; font - size: 14px; line - height: 22px; color: #696E74; margin - top: 10px;word-break:break-word ' ><p><p>The objective of this unit is to introduce students to the design and operation of biomedical instrumentation. To set the context, initially we will describe the pathway(s) from the identification of a medical problem through to the invention process, how biomedical instrumentation design takes place and how devices are developed into products used in medical settings.  We will then move onto the core framework used in the unit: The Generalised Medical Instrumentation System. This framework conveniently describes each of the main components in biomedical instrumentation: the measurand, sensing mechanism (and an actuating mechanism, where relevant), signal conditioning (analogue and digital), signal processing and output display.      </p><p>The key distinction between biomedical instrumentation and instrumentation, in general, is the biological measurand, the sensing mechanism and the actuating mechanisms. For this reason, more than half of the unit content will focus on these components. In particular, roughly one third of the content will focus on biophotonics instrumentation, i.e., biomedical instrumentation that utilises light to perform diagnosis and/or therapy. To ensure a detailed understanding of these devices, we will begin by exploring the physics of light and optical technology such as optical fibres, before progressing to describe the interaction of light with tissue and specific biophotonics devices, such as the imaging technique optical coherence tomography. </p><p>We will then spend 3-4 lectures on biopotentials, i.e., potential differences across cell membranes that form the basis for instrumentation such as ECG and EEGs. We will then progress to describe core concepts in analogue electronics relevant to biomedical instrumentation, in particular, instrumentation amplifiers. We will provide an overview of the noise sources in the in biomedical instrumentation and as the data from biomedical instruments is typically provided to users in digital format, we will also describe the core concepts of digital electronic devices, such as cardiotachometer.</p><p>All lectures will be recorded and uploaded to LMS. The lecture content will be assessed through a final exam worth 50% as well as 5 assignments that students are required to submit on Mondays of weeks 33, 34, 35, 37, and 38. The assignments will be a mixture of design problems and questions and will be released to students one week before the submittion date. Each assignment will be marked and each worth 5% of the final mark. In total 25% of the final mark is allocated to the assignments.</p><p>In the first half of the unit, there will be 7 tutorials sessions (practical-class) to support the lecture contents and provide an opportunity for the students to ask questions about lecture content and assignments. During the tutorials, lecturer presents revision material and solve extra problems and answer questions. The tutorial contents and extra problems will also be released to students before the tutorials each week. The online practical-class will be an opportunity for online students to ask any further questions.</p><p>In the second half of the unit, there will be 3 laboratory sessions, each worth 6% of the final mark, and 1 signal processing project worth 7% of the final mark. The 3 laboratory sessions and 1 signal processing project comprise 25% of the total mark. The labs will take place during weeks 39, 40, and 41, and signal processing project will take place during week 42. You will be provided with background reading and laboratory and signal processing instructions one week ahead of the day when the lab or project is scheduled. You need to submit your lab and project report after your scheduled session. Further information will be provided during the semester.</p></p></pre></p>

For face-to-face students, 3 laboratory will be held on campus and lab attendace is compulsory. During the lab session, student will be guided through the lab and will perform a series of measurements that will form the basis of the lab assessment. Whilst students will be working in groups in the laboratories, they will be asked to submit their measurements for individual assessment.

Each week, tutorial material will be uploaded to LMS and 2 hours of online practical-venue be held to create an opportunity for online students to ask any further questions. Online students who are based in Perth are strongly recomended to attend the 3 laboratory in person. For the students who are not able to attend in person, the 3 laboratory will be recorded and released on the LMS alongside the other background information and the lab instructions. The lab recordings should be watched and the lab reports should be completed based on that.&nbsp;There will also be an online signal processing session for the online students and it is strongly recommended for the online students to join this online session. </p></p></pre></p>

                    <h4>Late submission of Assignments</h4>
                    <p>A penalty of 5 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment item is deducted per day for the first 7 days (including weekends and public holidays) after which the assignment is not accepted. Each 24-hour block is recorded from the time the assignment is due.</p>
                    <p>For example, if an assignment is late by three days and was given 45 out of a possible mark of 50, you would receive a mark of 37.5 out of 50 (a mark of 2.5 is deducted per day).</p>
                    <p>If there are a number of tasks within an assessment item, the late penalty may be applied to the whole assessment item after all tasks have been completed.</p>
                    <p>If an assignment is graded Pass/Fail, failure to submit the assignment in time may result in the student not being permitted to take the final exam at the end of the semester or a teaching period and being unable to progress to the next level of the course or to graduate in the case where it is the final unit of the course;</p>
                    <h4>Penalty for exceeding word limit</h4>
                    <p>Where a submitted assignment exceeds the word limit, a penalty of 1 per cent of the total mark allocated for the assessment task applies for each 1 per cent in excess of the word limit, or the marking ceases once the word limit is reached.</p>
                    <h4>Academic conduct</h4>
                    <p>Academic Integrity is defined in the <a href="http://www.governance.uwa.edu.au/procedures/policies/policies-and-procedures?policy=UP07%2F21">University Policy on Academic Conduct</a> as "acting with the values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility in learning, teaching and research". UWA expects the highest degree of academic conduct from all students.</p>
                    <p>Penalties for breach of academic conduct vary according to seriousness of the case, and may include the requirement to do further work or repeat work; deduction of marks; the award of zero marks for the assessment; failure of one or more units; suspension from a course of study; exclusion from the University; non-conferral of a degree, diploma or other award to which the student would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
                    <p>Students should familiarise themselves with the information and resources available regarding <a href="http://www.student.uwa.edu.au/learning/resources/ace/conduct">academic conduct and ethical scholarship</a> at UWA.</p>
