    Department of Home Affairs
    
    Assistant Border Force Officer
    
    Mackay QLD, Gladstone QLD
    
    Overview of the Branch and Section:
    Working in the Australian Border Force
    The Australian Border Force (ABF) is the operational arm of the Department of Home Affairs (Home Affairs). The ABF is responsible for operational border, investigations, compliance, detention (facilities and centres) and enforcement functions, and continues to be Australia's customs service. Home Affairs delivers policy, regulatory and corporate support for the ABF. We consider the border not to be a purely physical barrier separating nation states, but a complex continuum stretching offshore and onshore, including the overseas, maritime, physical border and domestic dimensions of the border. Treating the border as a continuum allows an integrated, layered approach to provide border management in depth - working ahead of and behind the border, as well as at the border, to manage threats and take advantage of opportunities. By applying an intelligence-led model and working with our partner agencies across the border continuum, we deliver effective border control over who and what has the right to enter or exit, and under what conditions.

    THE OPPORTUNITY
    
    As Chief People Officer, you will provide strategic leadership and management of DFATs workforce and drive the departments performance and culture. You will lead teams delivering client-focussed HR enabling services including strategic HR and people policy, HR operations, workforce development and support in Australia and across the departments global network.
    
    As a member of the departments leadership cohort, you will support our ambitious and forward-looking reform agenda by leading the modernisation of the departments HR model. This includes developing a strong HR capability to support our workforce needs while also building the organisational capability required to achieve departmental priorities and outcomes. In a rapidly changing and increasingly contested global operating environment, you will play a vital role in developing and embedding people strategies, practices and policies to support a contemporary, agile and responsive HR enabling service.
    
    The key duties of the position include:
    
    OUR IDEAL CANDIDATE
    
    You will have extensive experience leading and motivating teams across a range of HR functions, adopting a collaborative and inclusive leadership approach. You will have a proven track record of success in leading HR at a senior level and experience in establishing and driving transformative change initiatives and developing innovative solutions for complex and geographically dispersed organisations.
    
    You must be able to establish broad networks of people and organisations and be adept at communicating sensitively with stakeholders from diverse backgrounds, experiences and cultures. You will be able to manage sensitive and complex issues, with a focus on accountability and the application of strong judgement to deal with ambiguity and change.
    
    Strategic thinking, the ability to effectively manage risks and a high level of conceptual and analytical skills are essential to this role. Your performance will be judged by results and how you uphold APS and departmental values, including exemplary standards of integrity and professionalism.
    
    Tertiary qualifications (and/or demonstrated equivalent experience) in an HR discipline is highly desirable as is professional certification with the Australian Human Resource Institute (AHRI). Demonstrated understanding of Commonwealth public sector HR, governance frameworks and HR best practice is required. We welcome those with experience across the private, public and/or non-profit sectors.
    
    A knowledge of the international context in which DFAT operates, our key activities and the complex challenges and opportunities this poses for a workforce spread across more than 100 sites is highly desirable. Experience working in HR in organisations with diverse workforces, multiple capability requirements and varying local operating environments would also be valuable.
    
    Eligibility
    
    Candidates must be Australian citizens.
    
    This is a Positive Vetting security-designated position. Prior to engagement the selected candidate will be required to obtain an Australian national security clearance at Negative Vetting Level 2, and upon commencement will be required to obtain a clearance at Positive Vetting. Ongoing employment with the department requires the successful candidate to maintain a security clearance. Loss of a security clearance at any time will lead to termination of employment.
    
    A face-to-face interview is a critical part of the security clearance process. This interview will be conducted in Australia, preferably in Canberra. If you reside overseas, please be aware that you will be required to travel to Canberra at your own expense to undertake the security clearance interview. Interviews cannot be conducted by video link or Skype.

    Description
    
    Do you want to build a career that is truly worthwhile? Working at the World Bank Group provides a unique opportunity for you to help our clients solve their greatest development challenges. The World Bank Group is one of the largest sources of funding and knowledge for developing countries; a unique global partnership of five institutions dedicated to ending extreme poverty, increasing shared prosperity and promoting sustainable development. With 189 member countries and more than 120 offices worldwide, we work with public and private sector partners, investing in groundbreaking projects and using data, research, and technology to develop solutions to the most urgent global challenges. For more information, visit www.worldbank.org.
    
    Sustainable environment and natural resources management (ENRM) is at the heart of the WBG's poverty agenda. Biodiversity and natural resources constitute the social safety net of the poor, representing a food bank and often their only source of livelihood. Sustainable ENRM promotes a green, clean, and resilient world where natural resources  from forests to fisheries, freshwater, oceans, coastal zones and ecosystems  are managed to support livelihoods and strong economies. Sustainable ENRM builds a world better prepared for shocks and global challenges, helping countries limit their exposure to resource scarcity, more-volatile weather patterns, and the long-term consequences of climate change.
    
    The Environment &amp; Natural Resources (ENR) Global Practice has been set-up to deliver on the opportunities, benefits and outcomes offered by enhanced management of the environment and natural resources. The ENR GP has close to 300 operations under management, representing close to $7 billion, and a growing pipeline of new investments under active development. The practice consists of some 300 staff across the world plus numerous other staff in other Practices and Cross Cutting SAs that are professionally associated with it. ENR GP also manages the environmental risk aspects of about 2000 projects in the World Banks global portfolio. About 150 staff work specifically on environmental risk management / safeguards.
    
    Note: safeguards has been the global term for the World Banks environmental and social risk assessment and management support for the operations it finances. On October 1st, 2018 the World Bank switched from the safeguards policies to the new Environmental and Social Framework  ESF, and its 10 environmental and social standards (ESS) that govern ES compliance and sustainability in the Banks portfolio of investment project financing (IPF). Under the ESF safeguards are now defined as Environmental and Social Risk Management, ESRM. The safeguards policies still apply to projects that had conceptual designs approved before October 1st, 2018. In this job description, ES risk management and safeguards are used as synonyms, unless explicitly differentiated.
    
    The Environment &amp; Natural Resources Global Practice has three broad and distinct functions:
    
    1.Provides clients with lending and non-lending services aimed to support the GPs three core business lines, namely: (i) Forests, Watersheds and Sustainable Landscapes; (ii) Marine, Coastal and Aquatic Resources; and (iii) Pollution Management and Environmental Health. The GPs activities also include a focus on Clean and Resilient Growth through its work on environmental economics and support to institutional development.
    2.Supports effective environmental risk management and sustainability by managing risk at the project level and creating opportunities to advance sustainable development, in part through the implementation of the Banks environmental policies.
    3.Works closely with other sectors, including by leveraging GEF grant financing, to mainstream environmental considerations into their policies, strategies, and operations.
    
    ENRM activities in East Asia and the Pacific accounts for a substantial part of the ENR Global Practices business:
     delivery of about 10 operations per year, amounting to about $500 million annually
     an active dialogue on regional issues, such as climate change, coastal and marine economies, improving governance of natural resources, watershed management, pollution management, and wealth accounting and valuation of ecosystem services
     about 61 active projects in the portfolio, amounting to around $1.8 billion
     a key characteristic of the Bank program in the region is a high level of decentralization. In 2016, 70% of staff was located in the country level offices, and about 60% of operations are managed and led from the country level offices.
    
    Almost all environmental risk management / safeguards staff are based in country level offices outside of the Washington, D.C. headquarters. The underpinning of this decentralization rests on four main pillars:
    
     better integration at the field level to provide greater synergies and integrated responses
     decentralized management structure supported by regional and global knowledge
     provision of faster responses and management decisions to our clients
     the need to reposition ourselves in the region given the large urbanization and decentralization trend in almost all countries, the need to incorporate better environment dimensions of the fast growth rates and huge demand for infrastructure, and the need to better deal with governance issues and growing income disparities between urban centers and rural areas and lagging regions.
    
    Regional Context
    
    The East Asia and Pacific (EAP) Region presents a dramatic illustration of the global dynamics, opportunities and risks of the 21st century. After making the fastest progress in growth and poverty reduction of any region around the world in the last fifteen years, some countries in the region  such as Mongolia  are poised to become middle-income, and some are preparing to join the small group of high-income countries. Such a rapid transformation is leading to the largest shift in rural-to-urban population in human history, generating rising inequality within and across countries, leaving individuals and regions behind in the dash for prosperity. Meanwhile, the uncertainty in the advanced economies clouds the prospects for countries across the region which are being forced to adjust to changed growth and development prospects while addressing evolving impacts on macroeconomic stability, employment and poverty.
    
    EAP comprises of more than 20 countries, including China, several MICs, LICs, and fragile states (EAP has the second highest number of fragile states amongst all the Bank regions  6 of 7 are in the Pacific). The Region is characterized by generally rapid growth, both sophisticated and low capacity borrowers, and some highly dynamic sectors. At the same time, EAP countries are faced with weak governance environments. The Bank's program in EAP is multi-faceted and has grown rapidly in recent years: annual new lending in FY15 exceeded $6.0 billion; the existing portfolio consists of about 250 operations with a value of about $12 billion; and the TF program is significant (with a portfolio of about $1.2 billion). EAP consists of over 1000 staff with 25% in Washington and 75% based in the country offices in the six Country Management Units.
    
    Unit and Country Context
    
    The World Bank member countries of the Pacific Region (Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu); and Papua New Guinea are important clients for the World Bank. Five of these countries are considered fragile states. The World Banks existing portfolio in the Pacific is about 78 projects with a value of US$1.7 billion. New lending is about 15 projects with a value of US$360 million per year. Lending is expected to double in the next 3 years. The portfolio is heavily focused on infrastructure development, particularly airports, roads, ports, hydropower, solar power, coastal reinforcement; human resource development, particularly health and education; and natural resource management in such areas as fishery and forestry management. The entire portfolio is focused on the adaptation and risk reduction related to climate change and natural disasters, which are a very serious development challenge for this region. The Environment and Natural Resources Global Practice provides environmental safeguards and environmental risk management support to the broader World Bank portfolio in the Pacific and Papua New Guinea.
    
    The Environment and Natural Resource Management Global Practice Unit for East Asia and Pacific, for China, Indonesia and Pacific is managed by a Manager based in Singapore. This manager is supported by senior staff who provide day to day technical leadership in their areas of specialization and are responsible for providing technical and quality support for outputs across the region, leading the region-wide communities of practice, connecting staff to international knowledge, leading cutting-edge sector policy and lending work in the region, and mentoring staff mapped to that particular sector on the latest developments in that practice. In the case of environmental risk management / safeguards the manager is supported by a Regional Safeguards Coordinator (RSC), currently based in Bangkok, and a Pacific Regional Safeguards Focal Point based in Sydney, who are responsible for day to day management of safeguards activities. Most staff in the Environment and Natural Resources Practice are expected to provide at least part-time safeguards support in their area of technical expertise. About one third of the Environment and Natural Resources Practice staff in East Asia work exclusively on safeguards and environmental risk management. The regional management attaches particular importance to creating a supportive work environment based on the values of teamwork, transparency, trust and client services, accompanied by professional excellence.
