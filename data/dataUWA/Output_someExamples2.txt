Government Accountability—Law and Practice - Face to face / Blended learning is a unit at the UWA Law School.
The unit code is LAWS5378.
 Over recent decades there has been growth in government and an increasing diversification and complexity in government service provision. There has also been, for the most part, a concomitant rise in the number (and reach) of accountability agencies, so much so that some commentators now talk of the emergence of a fourth branch of government, the ‘integrity branch', to sit alongside of the executive, legislature and judiciary. These accountability agencies have responsibility for overseeing, investigating and educating the public sector in relation to matters such as corruption, misconduct, good decision making, and avoiding conflicts of interest. Such agencies play a vital role. Governments make decisions on a daily basis that directly shape many aspects of individual and corporate existence. With such regulation comes the need for transparency, responsibility and accountability. In the words of former Commonwealth Ombudsman Professor John McMillan, "In short, the power of government is pervasive, and accountability is an indispensable check on how that power is exercised." 
The outcomes of this unit are: understand the 'integrity' framework of government and the role of relevant agencies—particularly mechanisms relating to government accountability, transparency, integrity and review, and arrangements in place for the prevention of maladministration, inefficient and ineffective policy design and delivery, and corruption; understand the historical, political and social context for the development of the contemporary accountability framework; explain the various models of government accountability and critically assess the effectiveness, costs and benefits of these models; apply the law and theory learned to a range of case scenarios and explore possibilities for further development and reform of government accountability mechanisms; effectively locate and use key resources in the relevant areas of administrative law, including particularly the 'new' administrative law and the law underpinning government accountability.

Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies in Business - Face to face / Blended learning is a unit at the UWA Business School.
The unit code is BUSN5001.
 Blockchain is a foundational technology enabling a more efficient, secure and transparent economy. Blockchain is a particular type of a shared database, which is a subset of distributed ledger technologies (DLT). The technology allows for decentralised creation and distribution of digital assets, like cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), execution of smart contracts and operation of Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAO) - the backbone of Decentralised Finance (DeFi) and much more. Blockchain-based innovations open enormous opportunities for new business models, entrepreneurship and employment. However, if compromised, the technology can bring opposite results than intended. The origin and the essence of blockchain is inseparable from Bitcoin (2008) and other open public blockchains, like Ethereum. Open public blockchains that are not owned and controlled by any single commercial entity, or a government offer unique properties of decentralisation, high security, and immutability. These qualities are usually compromised to achieve industrial scalability by commercially motivated entities providing ‘blockchain' (i.e. DLT) applications for business. This interdisciplinary, non-technical and introductory level unit offers comprehensive knowledge of blockchain and critical evaluation of distributed ledger technologies in business. The unit combines sound theory with practice and the latest updates from practitioners working with the technology.

 Relational practice recognises that all of reality is constructed through relationships – for example, between organisms and their environments. In this sense, our reality is continually co-constructed, through a series of interactions. When we pay attention to these interactions, we open up spaces for deeper understanding of our social and physical environments, and of the ways that we impact and are impacted by them. We also commit to dialogue, which is an intentional form of interaction that foregrounds encounters with difference.
 
Throughout the unit, content will be explored experientially, thus giving participants an experience of relational practice and its benefits for addressing complex or wicked problems. Each week, students majoring in Gender Studies and/or Philosophy from UWA and the University of Denver will collaborate with industry professionals from teaching and social/youth/community work contexts, who will enrol in one of both of the unit modules for professional development.

The first module focuses on the applications of relational practice in the field of gender/sex. At this time, there is a need for experienced practitioners of dialogue in the field of gender/sex, particularly in institutional settings. The unit will therefore explore theories of gender/sex; the impact of Internet culture on gender/sex and sexuality education; and structural barriers to and opportunities for facilitating constructive communication and learning about gender/sex in institutional settings. 

In the second module, students will learn and practice skills in the pedagogical methodology of community of inquiry (CoI), which combines critical and creative thinking skills with collaborative dialogue. Designed to promote transferable, lifelong learning in children by cultivating curiosity, collaboration and self-correction, CoI is now used with all ages in numerous contexts, from preschools to retirement homes, hospitals, prisons, science centres and art galleries. 
The outcomes of this unit are: demonstrate knowledge of gender/sex theory and its applications in both popular culture and institutional settings; demonstrate an enhanced awareness of personal values and beliefs about gender/sex that impact interactions with others; demonstrate an understanding of relational practice and its possible applications; demonstrate an understanding of community of inquiry processes; apply basic principles of philosophy, including questioning, reasoning and critical thinking; facilitate community of inquiry processes.

Special unit: Communicating Across Difference - Face to face / Blended learning is a unit at the Humanities.
The unit code is GEND3001.
 Relational practice recognises that all of reality is constructed through relationships – for example, between organisms and their environments. In this sense, our reality is continually co-constructed, through a series of interactions. When we pay attention to these interactions, we open up spaces for deeper understanding of our social and physical environments, and of the ways that we impact and are impacted by them. We also commit to dialogue, which is an intentional form of interaction that foregrounds encounters with difference.
 
Throughout the unit, content will be explored experientially, thus giving participants an experience of relational practice and its benefits for addressing complex or wicked problems.

 Most of us experience the policy process post hoc. It is something done to us, by rich elites, shady politicians, and faceless bureaucrats. It often feels remote and obscure, even threatening. This unit aims to demystify public policy by examining the way that policy is made in contemporary societies. We start from the position that public policy is like any other human activity: it is the product of interests, conflicts, alliances, and inequalities between people. By the end of this unit you will be able understand and analyse these relationships at an advanced level. 

The unit adopts the theory of fields in order to make sense of the wealth of materials, theories, and case studies published on public policy. We will explore policy making through key theories in the study of public policy and profiling the key ‘players' in the game of public policy, paying particular attention to their strategies and interests. The unit is will also offer a detailed case study on a particular struggle within policy making – the appropriate place of evidence in policy. In sum, this unit provides you with the analytical tools to conceptualise and critique the specific figurations that produce ‘policy'. 
The outcomes of this unit are: demonstrate advanced knowledge of public policy making; critically explain the key actors and institutions involved in contemporary public policy; demonstrate the ability to analyse how these actors produce, challenge and express policy preferences; evaluate the extent to which theories of the policy process clarify or obscure our understanding of public policy; effectively communicate knowledge, ideas, analyses and arguments about public policy through oral and written formats.

 This unit will focus on the spectrum of animal diversity, from single celled organisms through to vertebrates.  This diversity will be categorised systematically into the 35 phyla, and classes of the major phyla, the organisation of which reflects their evolutionary history. The evolution of animals will be illustrated using the classic study of the change in body structure (‘bauplans'), from simple to complex tissues, organs, segmentation, limbs and other body parts.  This will be compared with evolution discerned by modern molecular sequence methods, and how the differences between these methods can be understood.  Factors influencing the evolution of animal diversity will be explored, within and between phyla, in the context of coincidental changes in climate, geology, and ecology throughout evolutionary history.  Theoretical concepts developed during lectures will be explored in laboratory classes. Representative species from major phyla and classes will be examined to understand body structure, and to demonstrate the characters used to categorise animals into phyla and classes.

Criminal Law - Face to face / Blended learning is a unit at the UWA Law School.
The unit code is LAWS4102.
 Criminal law reflects the values society protects through a punitive system of sanctions. It therefore requires an ongoing engagement with ethical, social and political perspectives. It emphasises the underlying moral questions which criminal law confronts, and the wider context within which it operates and the way in which the legislature and the courts react to perceived social problems. The unit explores and critically assesses core concepts which underlie criminal responsibility, and relates these concepts to substantive criminal offences, defences and principles of criminal responsibility. As Western Australia has a criminal code, it considers these concepts within a statutory context, although it also examines other sources of criminal law to provide a wider insight into the construction of criminal liability. It also develops skills in legal problem solving and case analysis.

Social Media and the Law - Face to face / Blended learning is a unit at the UWA Law School.
The unit code is LAWS3317.
 More than a billion people, businesses, governments and other entities currently use social media. Judicial officers, courts, lawyers and other individuals in the legal system also use social media. However, the law generally struggles to keep up with making changes that are necessary or beneficial due to social media's existence. For example, most Australian courts only developed policies/Australian governments only passed legislation concerning whether journalists can use social media in courtrooms about seven years after social media was created and years after millions of Australians started to use it. This unit gives students an understanding of many of the key legal and ethical issues that social media raises for the law.

In this unit, students learn about some of the areas in which social media plays a significant role in the law. In the first eight lectures students learn about how social media impacts upon specific stakeholders in the legal system. For the next four lectures students learn about how social media impacts upon specific areas of law.
Four main themes of this unit are: (a) social media poses many challenges and benefits for the legal system and there are many more yet to come; (b) Australian law is slow to adapt to social media; (c) in some instances social media creates new situations that the legal system has yet to experience before and in some instances social media may simply be a contemporary take on a long-standing issue; it can be contentious which situation is which; and (d) it can be challenging to decide whether new ethical guidelines are necessary that apply to social media or whether existing ethical guidelines are sufficient to apply to social media (e.g. ethical guidelines for the judiciary and for lawyers). 
The outcomes of this unit are: demonstrate an understanding of what social media are and the main social media that Australians use; explain who are the key legal stakeholders affected by social media and the challenges and opportunities that they face; describe how social media impacts upon established areas of law, including defamation, criminal law, employment law and evidence; compare and contrast the approach that courts in different common law systems have taken regarding social media and the law.

Evidence - Face to face / Blended learning is a unit at the UWA Law School.
The unit code is LAWS5107.
 Evidence is about the adversarial trial which is our society's primary, ultimate mechanism for determining disputed facts for the purpose of assigning legal liability. The study of the rules of evidence is an examination of procedure and substance. The unit looks at a set of rules which determine the process of a trial and which embodies theories of knowledge and morality—How best do we arrive at a truth? How best do we balance truth and fairness? At a trial, two conflicting stories are told and after hearing the stories, a fact-finder (jury, judge or magistrate) must say 'yes' or 'no' to the story told by the prosecution/plaintiff. It matters, in determining that 'yes' or 'no', what information the fact-finder is allowed to hear, what use they are allowed to make of what they hear, and even how sure they need to be in order to say 'yes'. It is the rules of evidence which determine these things. Students learn the major rules of evidence governing a trial in Western Australia and make comparisons with rules from other jurisdictions. They extend skills of case analysis, legal reasoning and statutory interpretation by considering hypothetical scenarios—Is certain evidence admissible? If so, how can it be used and by whom? Is there enough evidence? Can it be countered? Students extend skills of legal reasoning and critical analysis by exploring the concept of a fair trial as it appears in specific principles and underpins the system of evidence rules as a whole.
