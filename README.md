# Curriculum Recommendation using Knowledge Graphs and Large Languge Models

This project is a part of the research titled "Curriculum Recommendation using Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models," conducted at the UWA.

Please note that the project is not yet finalized and is in the process of being completed.

How to run this code:

1. Data Preprocessing - This directory consists of Python files that preprocess specific data sets (Job Postings and Units) and parse them into triples. As the data is not publicly available, samples of the preprocessed data sets are provided, and this step can be omitted.
2. KG_Jobs.py and KG_Units.py - These Python files are responsible for creating Knowledge Graphs for Job Postings and Units, respectively.
3. main.py - In this Python file, you can build queries that will be answered using GPT-3.5 and the Knowledge Graphs.

In the directory Data, you can find preprocessed sample data for creating knowledge graphs.
